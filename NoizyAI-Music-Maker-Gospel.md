# NOIZY.AI MUSIC MAKER – ARTIST-FIRST GOSPEL 🙏🎛️

---

## ONE LINE

> **A PORTABLE NOIZY.AI-POWERED CO-CREATOR THAT HELPS YOU WRITE, ARRANGE, AND TRACK MUSIC WITHOUT EVER STEALING FROM YOU OR PRETENDING YOUR WORK IS ITS OWN.**

---

## WHAT THIS IS

NOT another "AI music generator" that spits out soulless loops.
NOT a tool that secretly trains on your work and sells it to someone else.
NOT a platform that buries rights-grabs in fine print.

**THIS IS A CO-CREATOR THAT RESPECTS YOU.**

Built by an artist.
For artists.
With the ethics carved in stone.
