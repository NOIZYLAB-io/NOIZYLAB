I need help setting up my iCloud email (rsplowman@icloud.com) in Gmail. I have an app-specific password: bdzw-ekxx-uhxi-pgym

Please guide me step-by-step through:
1. Adding rsplowman@icloud.com to Gmail to receive emails
2. Configuring it to send emails from this address
3. The correct IMAP and SMTP settings for iCloud

I need the exact settings:
- IMAP server, port, and security settings
- SMTP server, port, and security settings
- Username format (full email or just username)
- Where to enter the app-specific password

Configuration details I have:
- Email: rsplowman@icloud.com
- App-Specific Password: bdzw-ekxx-uhxi-pgym
- IMAP Server: imap.mail.me.com
- IMAP Port: 993
- IMAP Security: SSL/TLS
- SMTP Server: smtp.mail.me.com
- SMTP Port: 587
- SMTP Security: STARTTLS/TLS
- Username: rsplowman@icloud.com (full email address)

Common issues I want to avoid:
- Using wrong server (mail.icloud.com vs imap.mail.me.com)
- Wrong port numbers (110 vs 993)
- Authentication errors
- SSL/TLS configuration issues

Please provide clear, step-by-step instructions with the exact values I need to enter in Gmail's interface. Walk me through:
1. Where to find the settings in Gmail
2. What to click
3. What values to enter in each field
4. How to verify the setup worked

Also provide troubleshooting tips if the connection fails.
