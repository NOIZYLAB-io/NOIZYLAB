✅ Generated _MASTER_INDEX.md
✅ Created CONSOLIDATION_MANIFEST.json
```

**Result:** `/Volumes/4TBSG/MASTER_CONSOLIDATED_ARCHIVE/` fully organized

### Phase 3: Deployment Preparation ✅
```
✅ Created GOOGLE_DRIVE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
✅ Prepared 4 upload methods:
   1. Manual drag-and-drop
   2. Google Drive for Desktop sync
   3. Python upload script
   4. GitHub + Git
