# NOIZY.AI – CAPTURE → SONG → TRACK FLOW

> **FROM SPARK TO RELEASE. NOTHING GETS LOST.**

---

## THE PIPELINE

```
IDEA → SONG → TRACK → RELEASE → RIGHTS → MONEY
```

NOIZY.AI handles everything from the first messy idea to the clean credits.

---

## THE THREE OBJECTS

### 1. IDEA
**Any scrap of creativity.**

- Voice memo
- Lyric line
- Poem
- Riff
- Photo of notebook
- Random thought at 3am

**NO STRUCTURE NEEDED.**
Just capture it. Organize later.

---

### 2. SONG
**Work in progress.**

- Combination of ideas
- Has a working title
- Has an emerging concept
- Multiple versions/takes

**STATUS OPTIONS:**
- 💭 IDEA (early spark)
- 🔨 IN PROGRESS (building)
- 🎙️ TRACKING (recording)
- ✅ RELEASED (done)

---

### 3. TRACK
**Concrete recording.**

- Specific version of a song
- Has credits + splits
- Gets a NOIZY.TAG
- Can be released

**THIS IS WHERE RIGHTS START.**

---

## MOBILE CAPTURE FLOW

### TAP CAPTURE → THREE BUTTONS

#### 🎙️ VOICE IDEA
1. One tap → record
2. Auto-metadata: date/time, location (optional)
3. After stop:
   - "Name this?" (optional)
   - "Tag it?" (melody / chords / words / vibe)
   - "Link to existing song?" [list] / "New song"

#### 📝 TEXT IDEA
1. Type or dictate
2. Tag: lyric / poem / title / concept
3. Link to song or create new

#### 📎 ATTACH / IMPORT
1. Import: audio file, PDF, image of a page
2. Tag + link

### THE RULE
> **CAPTURE FIRST. LIGHT TAG SECOND. DEEP ORGANIZATION LATER.**

---

## SONG LAYER – WHERE IDEAS GROUP UP

### IN CATALOG → SONGS VIEW

Each SONG shows:
- Working title
- Short description / "what this is"
- Linked IDEAS (voice notes, lyrics, images, notes)
- Status indicator

### ACTIONS
- Mark status: IDEA → IN PROGRESS → TRACKING → RELEASED
- Ask NOIZY.AI ASSIST:
  - "Summarize what this song is about from all these pieces."
  - "Show me all unused ideas for this song."
  - "What's missing?"

---

## TRACK LAYER – WHERE RIGHTS START

### FROM A SONG, TAP: [CREATE TRACK]

Opens TRACK DETAILS:
- Track title
- Version (demo / album / live / remix)
- Contributors + roles
- Splits (rough is fine at first)

### ONCE A TRACK IS CREATED:
- It becomes a node in NOIZY.BRAIN
- It's eligible to get a NOIZY.TAG file
- It can later be linked to:
  - ISRC
  - Releases on DSPs
  - Usage data from NOIZY.RADAR
