We recommend using it this way for best results.  Alternatively, Stylus RMX may also be used with a simple host application to work as a sound module for live performance.  This type of use is also typical for large studios which use virtual instruments on slave computers to increase the amount of available processing power for large templates of sonic palletes which are always available to the composer.  Thirdly, you can also use Stylus RMX on dedicated hardware music computers like the MUSE Receptor and NEKO Keyboards, which essentially are PCs dedicated for music performance.  However, there are a few things to keep in mind with using RMX on a standalone system:  &#149; RMX must reside in a host application on the other computer Stylus RMX is a plug-in and does not function as a stand-alone application. It must function as a Virtual Instrument plug-in within a host regardless of what computer it's on. There are many free and inexpensive VST and Audio Unit host applications that will run Stylus RMX. You can get a comprehensive list of hosts on www.kvraudio.com  &#149; Drag-and-Drop support of MIDI files does not work directly You will need to drag the MIDI file from the RMX browser on the stand-alone computer first, and then transfer the MIDI file to your main computer for import into your sequencing/audio application. Two ideas for simplifying this process:  1.    Have the Main and Slave Computers networked and use a shared folder for the MIDI Files. That way when you drag on the slave computer to the shared folder, it will show up on the main computer right away.  2.    Use a USB Flash drive to transfer between computers. These are Mac/PC cross platform compatible and then you only keep the files in one place.  &#149; Tempo and Slave Sync It is possible to send MIDI clock information between computers, but for RMX to work on a slave computer, the sequencer host on the main computer needs to send it to the correct MIDI cable and the host on the stand-alone computer MUST be able to receive all MIDI tempo and sync information. Not all standalone hosts can receive clocking information (Steinberg V-Stack doesn't for example), so be sure to check the MIDI implementation of the stand-alone host for the slave computer.  &#149; Latency and Timing accuracy As a result of being on a stand-alone computer, the latency between MIDI and Audio interfaces will cause RMX to play later than it would on the main sequencing computer, so you will need to compensate for the latency. Also, when Stylus RMX is used on the main computer, the timing of playback is extremely tight - sample-accurate in most cases. On a slave system, this type of accuracy is not currently possible. &nbsp;");sQ1[13]=new Array("get_started/page11.html","GETTING STARTED - Multitimbral Set-up","","GETTING STARTED - Multitimbral Set-up  Stylus RMX is an eight channel multitimbral instrument that responds to MIDI channel's 1-8.

The reason it's such a difficult question to answer is because we designed SAGE as a very flexible and open system, which allows you to freely add FX and more editing power based on the needs of what you want to create. So switching from one Multi or Kit to another can require radically different amounts of your computer's resources. Standard use of RMX runs fine on even modest computer systems, but fully maxing out RMX's potential to use 399 high-powered FX units, 128 Power Filters and multiple huge Sound Menus simultaneously will be tough for even the most powerful, currently-available computers to handle. Conserving computer power and learning how to keep RMX running efficiently is essential info for all users.  There are several ways to conserve power in Stylus RMX. The following tips and techniques are especially useful in busy sessions when trying to make the most of CPU power and RAM usage:   CPU USAGE  &#149; Aux Sends If you are not using the AUX Sends on the Mixer Page, make sure ALL of them are Off (fully counter-clockwise). If they are all off, the whole AUX system is disengaged and saves CPU power. If even one Aux knob is turned up, the Aux system on all Racks and Parts is engaged even if no audio is passing through it.  &#149; Bypass Unused FX Bypassing FX Units saves CPU power. When Bypassed, the FX Unit does not consume CPU power.  &#149; Power Filter vs. Master Filter On the Edit Page, the Power Filter is a great sounding filter, but consumes significant power (that's why it sounds so good!). The Master Filter is also a very good sounding filter, but requires MUCH less power to run. If you are performing simple filtering tasks, try the Master Filter; it has a good sound and is much lighter on the CPU.  &#149; Power Filter FX vs. Valve Radio FX If you are in need of a basic Filtering effect as part of an FX rack, it's much more efficient to use the Valve Radio as a filter, than to use the Power Filter.  &#149; Aux FX vs. Insert FX When using FX like reverbs, it's usually better to use the reverb on an Aux Rack, instead of as an Insert. Often times, there are several sounds that need reverb; instead of placing, let's say 6 reverbs on 6 Inserts, you can place only one reverb on an Aux Rack and then use the Aux Sends to send all six sounds to the single Aux Rack for reverb. This is far more efficient on the CPU.  &#149; Remember that Creating New Edit Groups Copies All FX/Filters too! When creating a new Edit Group, it's essential to keep in mind that the newly created Edit Group copies all the FX Inserts from the &#147;Main&#148; Edit Group. So, if you have Wah-Wah and PRO-Verb FX Units on &#147;Main&#148;, the new Edit Group will also have another Wah-Wah and PRO-Verb rack inserted; and so will any other Edit Groups created on that Part. If you create a lot of Edit Groups, this FX copying can lead to a massive amount of CPU usage. The same principle is true for the Power Filter on the Edit Page.  &#149; EZ-Verb vs. PRO-Verb Contrary to what you might think, EZ-Verb doesn't necessarily use less CPU power than PRO-Verb. This is because PRO-Verb has a variable CPU Power parameter, where EZ-Verb's CPU Power is fixed. This parameter changes the number of reflections in the reverb signal, and a higher setting is not always a &#147;better&#148; sound -but more reflections require a higher amount of power to achieve. Sometimes lower CPU settings will produce a more desirable result of room reflections. If PRO-verb is set to maximum CPU, it takes much more power than EZ-Verb - while lower PRO Verb CPU settings (like the default settings) can actually require less power than EZ-Verb.  NOTE: When using PRO-Verb, remember that the CPU usage changes with every patch you load, and the results can be quite different from patch to patch.   MEMORY USAGE  RMX loads all Elements into your computer's onboard RAM Memory for playback. As with all applications that use RAM, we recommend getting as much as you can into your system.  Since Memory is shared with your host application, operating system and other open applications and plug-ins, it's good to know how RMX handles memory, so that you can optimize your use of it.  &#149; Slice Menu MIDI Mode vs. Groove Menu MIDI Mode Stay in Slice Menu MIDI Mode if you're not using an entire Suite of Grooves. In Slice Menu Mode, RMX only loads the selected Element and the Element below it. In Groove Menu Mode, RMX loads ALL the Elements of a Suite into RAM. This can be very demanding on RAM if several Parts are in Groove Menu Mode and the Suites are large.  &#149; Multiple Sound Menus Remember that even if you are using a sound menu only for a single hit, the whole Sound Menu element is still loaded into RAM. Some sound menus like the Cymbals and Cinematic categories take a lot of RAM, because they contain many long stereo hits in a single element. If you are running out of RAM, you can render/bounce some sound menu elements to audio to free up your RAM again.  &#149; Multiple Groove Menus It's possible to have core library Groove Menus that include up to 60 Groove elements per part. In Groove Menu MIDI Mode, each of these Groove Menus loads all of the Groove Elements into memory for instantaneous access and simultaneous playing. So it's possible to load up to 480 Grooves into a single RMX instance for simultaneous playback! Obviously, this will use a huge about of RAM, so be aware that Groove Menus are very memory hungry.  HINT: You can use the Memory Display mode of the Value display window in the Footer to view how much RAM you are currently using. &nbsp;");sQ1[19]=new Array("general/dir_structure/index.html","DIRECTORY STRUCTURE - The SAGE directory","","DIRECTORY STRUCTURE - The SAGE directory   The SAGE directory contains everything that the Stylus RMX software plug-in needs to function.

The Installation Chapter covered the initial placement of the SAGE directory. This chapter will describe the contents of the SAGE directory.  REFERENCE: See the Installation chapter for info about how to move the SAGE directory to another drive on your system.  There are two main directories inside the SAGE directory: SAGE LIBRARIES and STYLUS RMX  &nbsp;");sQ1[20]=new Array("general/defaults/index.html","DEFAULT SETTINGS - Introduction/Multi Mode","","DEFAULT SETTINGS - Introduction/Multi Mode  There is an extensive Default settings system in Stylus RMX that allows you to customize RMX's behavior when loading, clearing and reverting. This feature does not appear on the RMX interface, but you can take advantage of it by Saving your default settings in a special directory dedicated for this purpose.  When an instance of Stylus RMX is first loaded, RMX searches for a Default multi patch file to load. RMX looks inside the SAGE/Stylus RMX/Patches/defaults directory for a file called &#147;default.mlt_rmx&#148;. This is the file RMX loads as it's default for the entire plug-in.    Spectrasonics has provided a default setup for RMX, but you can create your own and replace the factory default settings with a custom template.  Here's how to create your own custom default multi settings template:  &#149; Before opening the RMX plug-in, go to the SAGE/Stylus RMX/Patches/defaults directory and make a safety copy of the &#147;default.mlt_rmx&#148; file and archive it. This will allow you to return to the factory default settings in the future if necessary.  &#149; Open an instance of Stylus RMX in your host.  &#149; Make some settings changes that you would like to see load upon each instantiation of RMX. You can choose to customize any settings that you wish for any part - from the status of the Chaos Designer, to what MIDI Mode each part boots up in, to the Trigger Mode settings on each Part, to what FX are loaded on any of the FX racks, etc.  HINT: The MIDI Learn settings for your specific hardware controller is very useful to store in the default multi. This way, RMX will open every time setup to your custom hardware controller settings.  &#149; Save the Multi and call it &#147;default.mlt_rmx&#148; inside the SAGE/Stylus RMX/Patches/defaults directory. You will be asked if you want to overwrite the existing default patch.  Now whenever you open the RMX plug-in, it will open with these settings each time. Also, if you perform a Multi Clear operation, RMX will return to these same settings.    &nbsp;");sQ1[21]=new Array("concepts/index.html","CONCEPTS","","CONCEPTS  This chapter covers key concepts to understand about the Stylus RMX Realtime Groove Module system that might not be obvious to you by simply looking at the plug-in interface pages or investigating the specific features one at a time.

All the concepts in this chapter are very useful to know - mastering them will provide you with a far richer musical experience of using SAGE Technology and your Stylus RMX software.  &nbsp;");sQ1[22]=new Array("concepts/automation/index.html","AUTOMATION","","CONCEPTS - Automation  Automation and external MIDI Control give you the ability to remotely control the parameters of RMX and to record and edit these adjustments in your host. This can be achieved by either of two means: Parameter Automation and MIDI Automation. Deciding which type of Automation to use depends on a number of factors including which host you use, which parameters you want to automate and what type of physical controller (if any) you wish to use to adjust the parameters.  The parameters inside RMX can be automated via the host's automation feature. Each host handles Parameter Automation differently.  VIDEO: Please refer to the host-specific video tutorials for more information on how to enable automation in your host and to find out the capabilities of that automation system as it relates to Stylus RMX.  PARAMETER AUTOMATION PROS Parameter automation has two primary advantages:  &#149; It permits the use of the GUI as a control surfaceÑit's a simple matter of enabling automation in your host on the RMX Instrument channel strip and then mouse-clicking parameters directly on the RMX interface while the host is playing. As you manipulate the GUI controls, you can record those movements for playback or editing.  &#149; If your host supports it, parameter automation is capable of two-way communication. If your host and control surface support it, this means your control surface can display the names of the parameters controlled by each knob or fader, and each control can automatically update to show the current value of a parameter. For example, Mackie Control has displays which automatically display parameter names. And, motorized faders can move to show the current values of parameters, which is very useful when opening a song which contains plug-ins controlled by the surface.  PARAMETER AUTOMATION CONS Support for parameter automation varies widely from host to host, but there are always some limitations you need to be aware of, especially in the case of RMX due to the large number of parameters it contains.  Some hosts have nice features for creating and saving control surface configurations. Some have no support for parameter automation at all. Most hosts have a limit on the number of parameters which are available to be automated. For example, some only permit the first 128 parameters of a plug-in to be automated. In others, the limit is 1024 parameters. By comparison, RMX has nearly 20,000 parameters!  Other hosts have no such limit on the number of parameters, but that can be a double-edged sword. It means that any parameter may be recorded from the GUI. But, when setting up a control surface, the menu to select a parameter has so many entries in the case of RMX that it can take up to several minutes to pop up the menu! Also, due to the large number of parameters in RMX, relatively few actually have names.  If you're working in a host that limits the number of automation parameters, remember that the MIDI Learn feature of Stylus RMX can also be used to automate RMX's parameters as well. The combination of Automation and MIDI Learn gives you powerful real-time control of virtually all aspects of Stylus RMX.  MIDI LEARN AUTOMATION While MIDI automation lacks the ability to use the GUI as a control surface and lacks 2-way communication, it has two distinct advantages over parameter automation:  &#149; Universal Support While parameter automation support varies widely among hosts, almost all hosts have the ability to record and edit MIDI data.  &#149; Ease of Configuration The MIDI Learn feature in Stylus RMX makes it very simple to attach any MIDI controller (physical or virtual) to almost any RMX parameter.

It is a very flexible system that can adapt to the hardware MIDI controller you use and also allows any RMX parameter to then be recorded into the host application.  The process of Basic MIDI Learning a hardware control to an RMX parameter is extremely simple:  &#149; Select &#147;Learn Control&#148; in the MIDI Learn sub-menu  &#149; Move the parameter you wish to control on the RMX GUI  &#149; Move the hardware control on the MIDI device that is connected to RMX  That's it!

A Groove Menu is essentially a single patch or part containing a collection of related grooves at the same tempo, with one groove assigned to a different MIDI note of the keyboard. There are a couple of advantages to this approach of working:  &#149; It's possible to perform the collection of grooves together in an intuitive and musical way from a MIDI controller. This makes it very easy to layer and mix grooves together by playing multiple keys.  &#149; You can also effortlessly play different grooves at different times in the song, making the process of constructing a linear groove track on a single channel/part much easier than doing the same thing multitimbrally with several parts.  What's different about the way SAGE handles Groove Menus is that we no longer use specific Groove Menu patches. Instead, we use a special Groove Menu MIDI mode, which makes every Groove element in a Suite play in a Groove Menu style layout.  There are a number of significant advantages of this new &#147;Groove Menu MIDI mode&#148; style approach compared to the old way we used to do it on sample libraries and with Classic Stylus:  &#149; Special patches do not have to be created in order to achieve the Groove Menu result.  &#149; EVERY suite automatically works as a Groove Menu just by switching the MIDI mode!  &#149; Users can quickly and easily create their own Groove Menus by using the Favorites system.  &#149; With SAGE technology, special patches for different tempos are no longer necessary, all the Grooves are automatically always in sync and at the correct tempo with the host!  HINT: Check out the really cool &#147; Example Groove Menus&#148; sound directory in the Core Library, while you're in Groove Menu MIDI Mode. It's full of interesting examples of how to use Groove Menus that will make a lot of sense to you once you try them!  REFERENCE: Read the MIDI Modes chapter for more information.  VIDEO: Watch the &quot;Introduction&quot; and &quot;Time Signatures&quot; video tutorials for musical demonstrations of using Groove Menus. &nbsp;");sQ1[25]=new Array("concepts/grv_control/index.html","GROOVE CONTROL¨ - Introduction","","GROOVE CONTROL¨ - Introduction  Groove Control¨ is a proprietary system of sound development created by Spectrasonics &amp; ILIO that enables powerful, independent control over tempo, pitch, feel and pattern - with the maximum possible sound quality for every loop. The sliced audio approach of Groove Control allows you to change tempo over a wide range without affecting pitch, and most importantly - without introducing artifacts or undesirable sonic results. Groove Control even allows you to adjust the feel of an audio groove, by changing the timing with the quantization/swing features in your host.  VIDEO: Watch the &#147;Pattern Variations&quot;, &quot;Changing the Feel&#148; and &quot;Time Signatures&quot; tutorials for examples!  The results of Groove Control are heard in real-time, but are achieved without using DSP playback algorithms. Real-time DSP time-stretching algorithms are very convenient, but often affect the sound quality of a groove in a negative way - transients can be lost, the stereo field can be compromised, the feel can become sloppy and unwanted noise artifacts can be introduced into the sound. This is especially true when a groove is significantly slowed down from its original tempo. Groove Control avoids all of these problems and delivers consistently great sound quality.  WEB REFERENCE: Listen to the Sound Quality comparisons page for an example of the differences between Groove Control/SAGE technology and other methods of time stretching and audio slicing.  HOW DOES IT WORK? The most basic concept of Groove Control involves cutting a loop into smaller &#147;slices&#148; of audio based on the rhythmic content and then triggering those slices in real-time on playback with a corresponding sequence. The sequence contains the rhythm of the groove and triggers the slices exactly as they were originally performed. In MIDI, each audio slice corresponds with a note:  Each Groove Control groove is always accompanied by a special sequence that triggers the slices in the proper rhythm. After working with GC MIDI files for a while, the sequence will become a familiar sight -- a rising chromatic line of MIDI notes.   NOTE: Groove Control MIDI Files are intended to be played with their matching Groove Elements. They will not work correctly with other groove elements and the note mapping is not GM compatible for playing MIDI drum kits or visa-versa.   HOW IS GROOVE CONTROL SLICING UNIQUE? What makes the Groove Control sound development process superior to other generic/automatic audio slicing applications is in the special methods, tools and techniques that Spectrasonics uses to create the Groove Control slices for each groove. This proprietary process that the members of our Groove Control sound development team learn, is something like a gourmet recipe: It takes a great deal of training, skill, and time - but the superior end results are well worth the effort!  All Groove Control products have to be approved by a review panel that judges the quality and versatility of the slicing methods for each and every groove on the product before the product can receive the official Groove Control¨ logo. So when you see that logo, it's a always guarantee of a certain level of quality and flexibility you can expect.  The ultimate goal of the Groove Control slice audio method is to allow the end user the most flexibility to manipulate a groove while maintaining the highest audio quality possible.   &nbsp;");sQ1[26]=new Array("concepts/page02.html","TIME SIGNATURES","","CONCEPTS - Time Signatures  Stylus RMX is a very versatile groove instrument that can be utilized in any time signature. Keep in mind that there are no dedicated controls or features on the standard RMX interface that deal specifically with time signatures. So in order to use version 1.5 in different time signatures, you will do it by interacting with your host features and physical MIDI controllers.  Since &#147;RMX&#148; stands for &#147;Remix&#148;, most of the groove elements in the Stylus RMX core library were developed in the common time signature of 4/4. If you are interested in working in other time signatures, there are several ways to do this:   GROOVE MODIFICATION  &#149; Edit MIDI Files in your host While this is not an instant or real-time process, it is quite easy in Slice Menu mode to edit a groove's MIDI notes within your host application. This allows you to change the time signature and pattern of the original groove to better match the music you are working on.  VIDEO: Be sure to watch the &quot;Time Signatures&quot; tutorial, which shows the process in detail.  REFERENCE: Read the Groove Control chapter for more information    GROOVE CREATION  &#149; Play or build parts in Slice Menu mode You can think of every Groove Element not only as a pre-made audio loop, but also as a set of sounds that can be played or triggered manually to build your own custom patterns from scratch in any time signature. The slices you manually trigger in each groove element can easily combine together in a musical way, since they come from the same audio loop.  The idea is that instead of &#147;deconstructing&#148; a groove, you are &#147;reconstructing&#148; a brand new one from the slices. This can be done by simply playing the slices manually from your MIDI controller, or by programming a new MIDI file using the sequencing capabilities of your host. In this technique, the groove element is acting simply as a sound source for your own rhythm performance or programming.  &#149; Play or build parts with the Sound Menus Something many users overlook is that the RMX Core Library contains a truly massive library of over 10,0000 unique single shot sounds in the Sound Menus part of the library. Check them out with your MIDI Controller and have fun sequencing any patterns in any time signatures you want!  REFERENCE: Read the Sound Menus chapter for more info!  &#149; Play or build parts in Kit mode In Kit Mode, RMX is a very powerful drum module and adheres to the General-MIDI specification. Building and performing your own grooves in RMX allows you to fully customize every aspect of a groove, including the time signature. REFERENCE: Read the Kit Mode chapter for more info!  &#149; Play or build parts in Groove Menu mode Using a combination of Next 16th Trigger Mode and Groove Menu MIDI mode allows you to start and stop the playback of groove elements from MIDI notes. Many interesting time signature variations can be created in real-time using this simple method of shortening or lengthening a groove. This method of &#147;groove performance&#148; works especially well with percussion grooves.   VIDEO: Watch the &#147;Time Signatures&#148; tutorial video for demos of all of these techniques!    GROOVE EXPANSION  &#149; Import audio files of other time signature loops via the SAGE Converter This allows you to import other non-4/4 ReCycle REX files or any of your own custom audio loop material you may have created outside of RMX.  REFERENCE: Read the Importing Audio and SAGE Converter chapters for more info!  &#149; SAGE Xpanders Several of the SAGE Xpanders from Spectrasonics and ILIO contain some non-4/4 grooves, including: Liquid Grooves, Burning Grooves, Metamorphosis and Ethno Techno.  REFERENCE: Read the SAGE Xpanders chapter for more info.

This means literally unlimited possibilities for remixing your own loops, by turning them into S.A.G.E. format Groove Elements that can be used within Stylus RMX.  You will need the following tools to import your own audio loops into RMX:  &#149; The SAGE Converter utility application (included)  &#149; Propellerheads ReCycleª application (available at most major music software retailers)   ReCycle is a very popular software program created by Propellerheads that can cut up an audio loop WAV or AIFF file into a sliced &#147;REX File&#148; that can be converted into Stylus RMX via the SAGE Converter. REX files are quite useful because they are compatible with many other audio applications and hosts as well, including Reason, Logic, Cubase, Digital Performer and many others.  Can I import my own Kit Modules or make Sound Menus? It is currently only possible to convert user audio loops into RMX Groove Elements. Sound Menu elements and Kit Module elements may only be created by Spectrasonics.  However, there is a little trick to make your own single hit menus that will play in RMX by making a &#147;fake&#148; groove element with the samples you need. Here's the process for this trick:  &#149; Place all your samples in a track and spread them out to make sure they don't overlap at all. &#149; Bounce all these sounds into a single audio file. &#149; Then create a REX file with a slice in front of each hit. &#149; Import using the SAGE Converter.  In Slice Menu MIDI mode, each hit will appear on its own key. This can be a useful trick if you have a few samples that you'd like to import into RMX.

VIDEO: Be sure to watch the MIDI Mode and Trigger Mode tutorial videos!  &nbsp;");sQ1[36]=new Array("part_modes/midi_modes/index.html","MIDI MODES - Introduction","","MIDI MODES - Introduction   The MIDI Mode is selected by the drop-down menu display in the lower right corner of the Footer.  MIDI Mode is a very important function of Stylus RMX, which determines how each part responds to incoming MIDI note data and what type of playback result occurs when the MIDI note is received. The MIDI Mode affects how grooves are presented on the keyboard, what kind of MIDI files are available for Drag-and-Drop and how Edit Groups work. Choosing between MIDI Modes also controls how much of a Suite gets loaded into memory when a Suite is selected.  There are three possible MIDI Modes for each part:  Slice Menu, Groove Menu and Sound Menu.  Slice Menu and Groove Menu modes work exclusively with Groove Elements. Sound Menu mode is only available when working with Sound Menu Elements and is selected automatically.  VIDEO: One of the key tutorials is the MIDI Modes videoÉbe sure to check it out!   GROOVE ELEMENTS MIDI Mode is most commonly changed when working with Groove elements. The two different ways of working with Grooves are selected by changing the MIDI Mode. The basic differences:  &#149; Slice Menu mode is ideal when you want to have a single groove with all of its slices presented across the keyboard, with each slice triggered by an independent note.  &#149; Groove Menu mode allows you to perform or arrange with dozens of entire grooves spread across a single MIDI keyboard - using each note on the keyboard to play a different groove.    MORE GENERAL CONCEPTS  &#149; It is not possible to have more than one MIDI mode selected on the same Part.  &#149; When using Drag-and-Drop MIDI Files, you must be in the same MIDI Mode during sequencer playback as you were when the file was Drag-and-Dropped. For example, if a MIDI file was Drag-and-Dropped with Groove Menu mode active, the file would contain only a single MIDI note. If you switched to Slice Menu Mode and tried to play the Groove from the sequencer, only one slice of the Groove would play. This is also true for MIDI that you record on a MIDI track. If you recorded your own performance in Groove Menu Mode, you would have to make sure the Part was in Groove Menu Mode during playback. This is rarely an issue you need to think about, since all of the Stylus RMX plug-in settings are saved with the song file. When you open the song later, it will be in the same state as when you saved it.  &#149; It is possible to switch between MIDI Modes in the same Suite and not lose settings like Edit Groups. This is because the MIDI Mode changes the presentation of Grooves for different editing tasks within the same Suite, without resetting the parameters for that suite.  REFERENCE: Kit mode has its own types of MIDI modes, which are discussed HERE  NOTE: MIDI Modes and Trigger Modes can both be set independently on each RMX Part. &nbsp;");sQ1[37]=new Array("part_modes/trigger_modes/index.html","TRIGGER MODES - Introduction","","TRIGGER MODES - Introduction   Trigger Mode controls the playback timing synchronization of all the Elements on a particular part. This feature is extremely useful in Groove Menu MIDI Mode.  VIDEO: Watch the Trigger Mode video tutorial for a demonstration of this useful feature.  When Groove Menu MIDI mode is active, the Trigger Mode feature makes it possible to trigger all the Groove Elements of a Suite in real-time, via MIDI notes, and yet keep them all synchronized with each other and with the rest of a sequence!  In the past, playing any looped audio material live in-sync with other musical elements was challenging because precise timing was required. This was difficult to do for a variety of reasonsÑlatencies, inaccurate performances, etc. Trigger Mode solves these problems by input quantizing live MIDI input when in Groove Menu MIDI mode. With trigger mode, RMX is able to delay the beginning of audio playback of the grooves from each incoming MIDI note, until the sequencer reaches the next point on the bar/beat grid. This makes it extremely easy to play multiple loops in a live performance with complete synchronization.  HINT: SAGE Xpanders like Backbeat and Retrofunk include a lot of drum fill Elements. It's very easy to play fills live when using the Trigger Mode feature.  Trigger Mode controls the playback start time of:  &#149; MIDI notes played live via a keyboard in Groove Menu mode  &#149; MIDI notes played from a sequencer track in Groove Menu mode  &#149; Groove Elements selected via the mouse in the Elements window on the Browser Page in both Groove Menu and Slice Menu MIDI modes.  &#149; The Part Play buttons in both Groove Menu and Slice Menu MIDI modes.  &#149; The All Play button in both Groove Menu and Slice Menu MIDI modes.

VIDEO: Check out the &#147;Browser - Core Library Tour&#148; and &quot;RMX 1.5 update Tour&quot; tutorials for a demo of what's available in the RMX Core Library and how it is organized.  When the Master Directory is set to &#147;Core Library&#148;, the resulting SOUND DIRECTORY drop-down menu will display the following menu options:    DEFAULT Stylus RMX defaults to this sound upon a new instantiation or after switching back to Multi Mode from Kit Mode. Part one will default to this directory and the only Element available initially is the &#147;Sound Check&#148; sine wave test tone, which is useful for confirming that MIDI and audio are working properly. This element is loaded automatically on part one for this purpose of verifying audio.   The next two directories contain all of the source Groove elements in the Core Library:  RMX GROOVES This sound directory provides access to all of the new Groove Suites included in the Stylus RMX Core Library that were not presented in the original Classic version of Stylus. There is a wealth of material in this section. Most of the Suites have Elements which contain several alternate versions, remixes and separated components for remixing.  CLASSIC STYLUS All of the groove material from the original &#147;Classic&#148; Stylus Vinyl Groove Module plug-in is included in this sound directory.  HINT: The percussion grooves from Classic Stylus are included at the bottom of this Suite. All of the other original material from Stylus Classic is located within the Example Groove Menus and Sound Menus sound directories of the Core Library.   The next seven directories contain re-organizations of the source Groove elements in the Core Library for easier browsing. Grooves sometimes appear in multiple Sound Directories, but this is normal - as some grooves apply to many genres and categorizations.  GROOVE ELEMENTS This sound directory is very useful when looking for a groove played by a specific instrument type (Bongos, Congas, Kicks, Snares. etc.) This sound directory is a way of viewing all of the separate component grooves from &#147;RMX Grooves&#148; and &#147;Classic Stylus&#148; in one place, so that they may be searched by instrument. This directory is ideal to use when building grooves from scratch and also for when you want to use simpler patterns for a song. Version 1.5 adds a new &quot;Kicks 4x4&quot; suite for dance music as well as a new &quot;Tonal Elements&quot; suite that contains the majority of pitched groove elements in one place.  EXAMPLE: The Groove Elements directory is very useful when searching for a hi-hat pattern, as it allows you to audition all of the hi-hat patterns in one place. All the solo hi-hat grooves in the RMX Core Library are listed here in two easy to search Suites.  EPIC ENERGY This sound directory is a genre-based re-organization of the core library suites that have the most energy and drama. The sounds are usually quite hi-fi and with a lot of style in the sound design. These are where we've re-grouped all of the &quot;unique&quot; personality types of grooves that work great for action and dramatic settings.  BREAKBEATS This sound directory is a genre-based re-organization of the core library suites that sound like classic vinyl &quot;breakbeats&quot;. A breakbeat is the place on an old recording where the arrangement of the song &quot;breaks&quot; down to just the primary drumbeat. Of course, all our breakbeats are originally created and then pressed to vinyl for re-sampling to give them that authentic sound. There's a good deal of cross-over in this section between Classic Stylus and Urban categories, but here we've only included the Suites that have that authentic live vinyl break vibe to them. Very useful for Drum and Bass and many dance/hip-hop styles.  ELECTRONIC This sound directory is a genre-based re-organization of the core library suites that have an electro or sound design-based focus. The feel here is usually more straight and more techno. Plenty of interesting moody electronic sound design in here too.  URBAN This sound directory is a genre-based re-organization of the core library suites that have hip-hop/R&amp;B/reggae/ragga/two-step/street-style flavas. Lots of cross-over from Breakbeats, but this focuses more on the MPC shuffle feels and includes the sparser, more modern hip-hop programming approach as well.  SWING This sound directory is a genre-based re-organization of the core library suites that swing or have shuffle feels...super useful!  CLUB This sound directory is a genre-based re-organization of the core library suites that have either a &quot;four-on-the-floor&quot;(4x4) beat or a distinct club/party feel to them. Very useful to have them all in one place!  HINT: Don't miss the new &quot;Kicks 4x4&quot; suite in the Groove Elements directory, which has many new kicks for dance/club/house styles - as well as all the new Club Multi patches!   SOUND MENUS This sound directory offers a massive variety of single-hit material for programming your own patterns and using RMX as a pure sound module that can be played via MIDI. There are over 10,000 hits in this section! The sounds range from thousands of kicks, snares, hi-hats, percussion to huge Cinematic Hits, Guitar bits, Radio Wave FX, Big Band Vintage Hits, many types of Vinyl scratching FX and MUCH more. This is a fun area to explore and a little time spent here will definitely be rewarding.  NOTE: When you click on a Sound Menu Element, it doesn't play automatically like a Groove Element does. It doesn't mean that it's broken, it just means that you have to trigger it via MIDI. Clicking a sound menu simply loads it and makes it ready for playing from your MIDI controller.  HINT: Don't miss out on fully checking out the Sound Menu part of the Core library. A lot of users miss all of this great material in the Core Library simply because they don't try it or because they aren't ready-made grooves. A great deal of this material in the Sound Menus appears ONLY in this section and is not duplicated anywhere else!   EXAMPLE GROOVE MENUS This sound directory serves two purposes: It provides some great examples of how different grooves in the core library can be rearranged in genre-based suites for real-time playing, and it also recreates the Groove Menu patches from the original &#147;Classic&#148; Stylus plug-in.  MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THESE OUT! You'll learn a lot and they are quite useful in their own right.  The important thing to enjoy this section of the Core Library is that you must be in Groove Menu MIDI Mode so that all the grooves will load and play across the keyboard. If you are a user of Classic Stylus, you may remember that it had a different Groove Menu patch for every tempo. This redundancy is no longer necessary because SAGE is able to synchronize all the Grooves to the host's tempo in real-time!   HINT: Remember that you can create your own custom Groove Menus very easily by using the User Favorites system.

SUITES A Suite is essentially a folder/sub-directory that contains one or more Elements. Once a Directory has been selected, the left Suites column will display all the Suites available in that directory. Clicking a Suite name reveals it's contents in the Elements column on the right. In the picture above, RMX Grooves is selected as the Sound Directory. As a result, the Suites column displays a long list of all the available Suites in this Sound Directory, organized alphabetically by tempo from slowest to fastest original tempo. No sound can be played directly in the Suites column.  ELEMENTS The right Elements column contains the sound elements that belong to the selected Suite. They can include the component parts of the full mix, mix variations, no kick and no snare versions, or some Xpanders include different sections of a linear performance like verse, chorus, bridge, fills, etc.  There are three different types of Elements in RMX: Grooves, Sound Menus and Kit Modules  VIDEO: Watch the &#147;Browser - Elements&#148; video tutorial to learn more about each of the three types of Elements and how they work.   &nbsp;");sQ1[55]=new Array("browser/page07.html","THE BROWSER - Grooves","","THE BROWSER - Grooves   There are three different types of Elements in RMX: Grooves, Sound Menus and Kit Modules  &#149; GROOVE ELEMENTS are rhythm loops. Groove Elements produced by Spectrasonics are always easy to identify, since the original tempo of the groove are shown as the first four characters in the Element name like this:  125-Massive Vinyl Wood*   *NOTE: Converted/Imported grooves may not conform to this specification.  The original tempo listed at the beginning of the name gives you important information regarding what the &#147;intended&#148; tempo range is. Of course, RMX always plays back the groove element at the host's tempo, which may sound musically appropriate or not, depending on the rhythmic pattern and how rhythmically complex it is.  Groove Elements will always have a corresponding MIDI file in the MIDI FILE section of the Browser Page that can be drag-and-dropped to the host track or to your desktop.  To audition a Groove, click its name and it will begin playing at the tempo of your host application.  HINT: If your host transport is playing, Stylus RMX will also synchronize itself to the beat of the song, based on the Trigger Mode settings. This is a great way to try out Stylus RMX grooves in sync and in the context of an existing song.  There are three ways to stop auditioning the Groove:  &#149; Click the Element name again &#149; Click the Part Play button for that Part in the Footer &#149; Click the All Stop Button in the Footer  NOTE: RMX doesn't sync the start of playback to the host transport controls. If you want to audition an RMX groove on the downbeat of the song, simply click the groove or press the All Play button during the count-off before the first bar. If NEXT BEAT is selected as the TRIGGER MODE, Stylus RMX will begin playing on the downbeat of the song.

Since Stylus RMX is so much fun to use in working with loops, it can be easy to forget that it can also work extremely well as a massive sound module for producing your own rhythm tracks from scratch. There is a wide variety of sonic material presented in the Core Library, including thousands of drum sounds like kicks, snares, hi-hats, toms, cymbals and percussion - to long FX Sweeps, Vocoded Electro Hits, Guitar Bits and Retro Big Band Stabs and much more. Sound Menus elements are currently created exclusively by Spectrasonics and the mapping of the samples is fixed.  Sound Menu Elements always have the word &#147;MENU - &#148; before the beginning of the name.   NOTE: A Sound Menu cannot be auditioned by clicking it like a Groove Element; you must use an external MIDI source to trigger the soundsÉsuch as your MIDI Keyboard.  There can be up to 64 sounds in a Sound Menu element.  If a sound menu is less than 2 octaves, it usually begins on Middle C (MIDI note#60).  If a sound menu is greater than 2 octaves, it usually begins on low C (MIDI note#36).

The sounds here are mainly drum and cymbal sounds. They're organized for fast and efficient General MIDI-compatible kit building. Kit Module elements are created exclusively by Spectrasonics and the mapping of samples is fixed to the GM drum mapping standard.  The name of the Kit Module always begins with the type of sound:  KICK - SNARE - HIHAT - etcÉ.

When auditioning Grooves and Sound Menu Elements, a Speaker Indicator appears next to the most recently played Element.  In the picture above, 124-Light Years Big Groove is the most recently auditioned groove. The Speaker Indicator remains lit only while an Element is being triggered. Once the Element no longer plays, the Speaker Indicator disappears.  The Speaker Indicator feature works in Slice Menu, Groove Menu and Sound Menu MIDI Modes.  The Speaker is most useful when auditioning grooves in Groove Menu MIDI Mode from an external keyboard controller because it allows you to easily keep track of which groove is being auditioned. For example, the Elements in the picture above are grouped together in a large Favorites Suite. There are dozens of Groove Elements in this Suite. Keeping track of which groove is being auditioned is easy because the Speaker Indicator is indicating the most recently triggered groove.      &nbsp;");sQ1[59]=new Array("browser/page11.html","THE BROWSER - Settings Button","","THE BROWSER - Settings Button  The small SETTINGS button resides above the Elements column in the Browser. This button controls how RMX handles parameter settings when switching from one Element to another.    &#149; SETTINGS ON When the Settings button is active, Stylus RMX will reset a Part to a default state each time a different element is chosen in the Browser.  Here's an example of how this would be used:  Let's say you were working with a Groove and had already inserted a Wah-Wah and BPM Delay into the FX rack, adjusted the AMP Envelope and Coarse Pitch on the Edit Page and played with some Chaos parameters. If you then select a new Groove element in the Browser, all those changes you had made would be discarded and the Part would reset to its default parameter settings. This is highly useful if you like to experiment with many settings and then prefer to have the Part reset fully for each newly chosen Element. You can think of this as the typical preset selection function on most synthesizers - when a new preset is selected, everything is reset to the new preset settings. This is also how the original Classic Stylus plug-in worked.  &#149; SETTINGS OFF When the Settings button is turned off, Stylus RMX will always keep all of the current parameter settings in the part when choosing a different element in the Browser.  Let's look at the same example as above again:  If we made all the same changes and then switched Grooves, all those parameters and FX would remain and we could listen to the new Groove with these adjustments still in place. This option works well when you have a desired set of edits in place and you would like to try out different elements through these same parameter settings to see what they might sound like through these settings. You can think of this approach being more like the way a traditional &#147;waveform selector&#148; works on a synthesizer - the waveform can be freely selected, without any of the filter and envelopes changing values. An &#147;Edit Template&#148; is another way of thinking of this idea.  NOTE: Certain sounds in the Core and Xpansion libraries have special default settings unique to that element. To hear the originally intended sound in the Core and Expansion libraries, you should keep the Settings button turned ON when auditioning. All other elements will use the settings from the default.prt_rmx file located in the Defaults folder.  REFERENCE: The defaults system in RMX interacts with the Settings button in important ways. Find out more about the Default Settings system in RMX.

Once you have altered the tempo by using the Half and Double buttons, the MIDI file will also change - so the adjusted groove can be used on a MIDI track exactly as it is heard.  Speed Guidelines:  &#149; The Speed function only works on an internally playing groove element; it does not affect the speed of any incoming MIDI information from a sequencer track.  &#149; The Speed function only works if the Groove is playing at the moment the Half or Double button is pressed; if these buttons are pressed when RMX is stopped, then no speed change will occur.  &#149; The Half and Double buttons may be pressed multiple times for extreme speed changes.  &#149; In Groove Menu MIDI Mode, the Speed buttons will affect all of the Elements in the Suite.  &#149; Speed is a Part setting (not a patch parameter), so it is not affected by the SETTINGS button.  &#149; Speed is currently reset when selecting a new Groove Element.     The HALF button reduces the playback speed by 50% each time it is pressed. In other words, the groove plays back at Half-time tempo or Half-speed.  Starting at the host's tempo, you may halve the speed three times so the slowest the groove will play is 12.5% of the host's tempo.    The DOUBLE button increases the speed by 100% each time it is pressed. In other words, the groove plays back at Double-time tempo or twice as fast. Starting at the host's tempo, you may DOUBLE the speed three times which makes the groove play a maximum 800% faster than the current host's tempo.

FAVORITES AND MIDI MODES The Stylus RMX Favorites system works in both Slice Menu and Groove Menu MIDI Modes.  In Groove Menu MIDI mode, all the Groove Elements in a Favorites Suite are mapped as MIDI notes across the keyboard -each key triggering a different groove in the Suite. This is extremely useful for arranging grooves from many different Suites for live-playing on a single RMX Part.  Each Groove is assigned it's own MIDI note in chromatic/alphabetical order.  If there are less than 24 grooves in the Favorites Suite, they will be mapped in Groove Menu mode beginning in order from middle C (MIDI note#60).  If there are more than 24 grooves in the Favorites Suite, they will be mapped in Groove Menu mode beginning in order from low C (MIDI note#36).  In Slice Menu MIDI mode, only the currently selected groove element is accessible from incoming MIDI notes. In this case, all the individual slices of this groove are mapped across the keyboard.

To do so, simply select the Suite for deletion and then choose this option in the Favorites Utility menu to delete it.   Some Guidelines about Favorites Suites:  &#149; All Elements in a Favorites Suite are organized and mapped in alphabetical order. In regards to the Core and Expansion Libraries, this means that Groove Elements will be ordered based on their original tempos. Keep in mind that your Favorites Suite is not organized in the order that the elements were chosen, but alphabetically based on the element names.  &#149; If Groove Elements and Sound Menu Elements reside in the same list, the Elements that contain numbers as the beginning characters of their names appear first in numerical order. Any elements using letters as the beginning characters are listed in alphabetical order after the numeric elements. It is possible to combine Groove Elements and Sound Menu Elements into the same Favorites Suite if you want to organize a project or live set this way. However, keep in mind that RMX will ignore the Sound Menu elements when Groove Menu MIDI mode is selected.  &#149; Unsaved Current Favorites are remembered by RMX even when the plug-in is de-instantiated (closed).  &#149; An unsaved Current Favorites Suite cannot be deleted or cleared directly. You must first save the Current Favorites Suite and then you are free to delete it.  &#149; It is currently not possible from the RMX interface to add or remove an Element from a User Favorites Menu.

What this means in musical terms is that you can achieve results like having the Downbeats of a groove sounding with less of the same reverb unit than the Backbeats, etc. This is preferable to using multiple reverb inserts for each edit group, which is a waste of CPU power. All of these Edit Group AUX SENDS levels are routed through the AUX1 knob on the Mixer Page. This AUX1 send knob on the Mixer Page becomes a sort-of &#147;Master Send level&#148; to the AUX1 FX Rack for each Part's Edit Groups. &#149; The AUX1 send knob from the Mixer Page sends the signal into the input of the AUX1 FX Rack. &#149; The output of the AUX1 FX rack is routed (returned) directly to the Main Output (OUT A).  HINT: Although there are not dedicated Aux return knobs, you can insert an Imager FX unit in the last open slot of an Aux rack if you would like to have a master Aux Return level control for that rack.  NOTE: AUX Returns always route to output A regardless of what Output Assignment is chosen for the Groove.  REFERENCE: Please see the FX Racks chapter for more info on the AUX routing.   CPU CONSERVATION AND MUTING Please note that when all Aux Send knobs on the mixer are in the zero position, all AUX FX racks are internally bypassed/muted to preserved CPU power, since the FX are not in use. This conservation technique can cause a slightly unusual behavior compared to how aux sends work on a standard analog mixer. If you are used to quickly bringing an aux send up and down to add a momentary delay or reverb effect to a single beat (ala reggae dub-style missing techniques), and you are only using a single Aux send on one specific part in your mix, you'll notice that the FX units mute when the send is moved back to zero position, which makes that production technique not work correctly in this case. A simple solution is to raise another unused AUX send knob on the Mixer page. Now the AUX FX returns will not be muted when you move the desired aux send knob back to zero position. Conversely, it's a good idea to zero any unused sends on the mixer page, because ALL four FX racks are turned ON when ANY aux send knob is raised.  HINT: It's a good idea to manually bypass any unused FX units in a rack to save CPU use.

These Modes are for the whole system, meaning that all 8 Parts are always in the same Mode. For instance, it is not possible to have Parts 1-4 in Multi Mode and 5-8 in Kit Mode.  Multi Mode is for working with Groove Elements and Sound Menu Elements.  Kit Mode is exclusively for working with Kit Module elements - mapped drum hits that can be organized into General Midi-compatible drum kits. While there are a lot of single drum hits in Multi Mode via the Sound Menus, they are addressed very differently in Kit Mode.  REFERENCE: Please see the chapters on Multi Mode and Kit Mode for detailed information on these Modes.  MULTI / KIT NAME DISPLAY This window allows for easy loading of Multi Patches and Kit Patches. Click the window to reveal a drop-down menu of available Multi Patches or Kit Patches. There are a large number of factory Multi Patches and Kit Patches available here. However, it is very easy to save your own Multi Patches and Kit Patches. Saving them allows you to recall these Patches from the drop-down menu.

The Edit Page is accessed from the EDIT button in the Footer section of the Stylus RMX interface.  The Edit page actually has two different modes of operation: Standard Edit and Easy Edit   VIDEO: Watch the &quot;Edit Page Tour&quot; tutorial for a tour of each of the editing sections.   Standard Edit offers a complete set of synthesis parameters for maximum flexibility in shaping the sonic character of an element. It's the first page you see when you open Stylus RMX:      EASY EDIT is ideal for users that aren't familiar with synthesis. It offers a simpler view of the most useful controls found in Standard Edit, but in a more basic configuration with large controls:   All of the parameters found on the Easy Edit page are redundant to their counterparts on the Standard Edit Page. This means that a change on one of the pages is reflected on the other. For instance, if the PAN fader is moved fully to the right on the Easy Edit Page and you switch to the Standard Edit Page, then the PAN fader on the Standard Edit Page will also be fully panned right. To exit the Easy Edit Page, click the EASY button and you will return to the Standard Edit Page.  NOTE: All of the parameters on the Edit Pages are Edit Group specific.

There are three completely independent LFOs: AMP, FILTER and PAN per Edit Group. Each LFO has it's own sub-page with a full set of dedicated controls. To activate a sub-page, click one of the three sub-page buttons:  AMP SWITCH The Amplitude LFO modulates the volume of the audio.  FILTER SWITCH The Filter LFO modulates the Cutoff parameter in the Power Filter section. Please note that the Power Filter MUST be engaged for the Filter LFO to work.  PAN SWITCH The Pan LFO modulates the panning of the audio.  WAVEFORM SELECTOR This parameter allows you to choose the waveform the LFO uses for modulation. Clicking the up/down stepper switch arrows to scroll through the waveforms.  There are 7 waveforms to choose from:      Sine Wave     Triangle Wave     Square Wave     Rounded Square Wave     Ramp Wave     Reverse Ramp Wave     Sample and Hold (Random)    RATE KNOB This knob controls the speed of modulation. The Rate knob has two modes. These modes depend on the state of the Sync parameter:  &#149; SYNC OFF - The Rate parameter freewheels and uses Cycles Per Second (CPS) to control the LFO. The knob increases CPS as it's turned clockwise: 0 - 15 CPS.  &#149; SYNC ON - The Rate parameter uses rhythmic values along with the host's tempo to control the LFO so that it stays in sync with the groove. Turning the knob in this mode scrolls through different note value groups. It does not simply get faster as the knob is turned clockwise. Some examples of note values found spread out around the knob:  8x - this value stretches a cycle across 8 bars. 1/8 - this value cycles the LFO every 1/8 note. 1/8 dot - this value cycles the LFO every dotted 1/8 note. 1/8 triplet - this value cycles the LFO every 1/8 note triplet.

With the Chaos Designer, it is now possible to introduce user-controlled amounts of variation and improvisation to audio loops within RMX. The Chaos Designer rearranges the slices in musically intelligent ways, which can give the impression that the loops are improvising on their own! With the controls available to you, the results can be extremely subtle or radically wild. It is also possible to capture some of these variations into a MIDI file for repeatable results and further editing.

HINT: Chaos Designer produces a wide range of interesting possibilities. However, it is most powerful and musically useful when used in conjunction with the Edit Groups feature of Stylus RMX, which allows you to have independent control of Chaos on groups of slices and beats. The most musical results are when some beats in the rhythm are constant (like the quarter notes for example), and the remaining beats have chaos applied to them.

This is similar to the &#147;humanizing&#148; function found in many sequencers, but applied to audio loops. There are three parameters in this section that determine how much change occurs and what kind of change will occur:  TIMING This slider controls the probability of how often the timing of slices are changed. Raising the slider causes more slices to have their timing altered more often by the Chaos Designer. You can think of Zero on this slider as being &#147;Never&#148;, maximum being &#147;Always&#148; and in-between the two extremes are increasing ranges of &#147;Sometimes&#148;.  RANGE This knob controls the maximum amount of timing change away from the slices original timing positions in the groove. When this knob is turned fully counter-clockwise, then no timing variations will occur. When the knob is fully clockwise, the maximum possible degree of timing variations can happen when a slice is affected by Timing Chaos.  NOTE: In Timing Chaos, every time a slice is affected is a different random value of timing offset from the slice's original timing positions in the groove. The range control affects how wide the chaotic variance of timing will be, but it is not an exact or consistent offset of timing.  RUSH/DRAG This knob controls the direction of how the Timing Chaos will affect the slices. Turning the knob counter-clockwise forces the slices to fall before the original timing positions of the groove (earlier in time) - commonly called &#147;rushing&#148; the beat. Turning the knob clockwise forces the slices to fall after the original timing positions of the groove (later in time) - commonly called &#147;dragging&#148; the beat.  Leaving this knob in the center 12 o'clock position will allow slices to fall both before and after the original timing positions of the groove - commonly called &#147;sloppy&#148;!

When the knob is fully clockwise, the maximum possible degree of pitch variations can happen when a slice is affected by Pitch Chaos -which is approximately two octaves.  NOTE: In Pitch Chaos, every time a slice is affected is a different random value of pitch offset from the slice's original pitch. The range control affects how wide the chaotic variance of pitch will be, but it is not an exact or consistent transposition of the pitch.  DOWN/UP This knob controls the direction of how the Pitch Chaos will affect the slices. Turning the knob counter-clockwise forces the slices to shift downward or lower in pitch. Turning the knob clockwise forces the slices to shift upward or higher in pitch.  Leaving the knob at the center 12 o'clock position will allow slices to shift both higher and lower in pitch.

There are three parameters in this section that determine how much change occurs and what kind of change will occur:  DYNAMICS This slider controls the probability of how often slices amplitude are affected. Raising the slider causes more slices to change in amplitude more often. Imagine Zero on this slider as being &#147;Never&#148;, maximum being &#147;Always&#148; and in-between the two extremes are increasing ranges of &#147;Sometimes&#148;.  RANGE This knob controls the maximum amount of amplitude change. When it's turned fully counter-clockwise, then no Dynamics Chaos will happen. When the knob is fully clockwise, the maximum possible degree of amplitude variation can happen when a slice is affected by Dynamic Chaos.  NOTE: In Dynamics Chaos, every time a slice is affected is a different random value of amplitude offset from the slice's original level. Since the original level is always full amplitude, the range control also lowers the overall level of all slices, so that slices can also be increased in level when they are affected by Dynamics Chaos. The range control affects how wide the chaotic variance of level will be, but it is not an exact or consistent offset amount.  SOFT/LOUD This knob controls the slice's tendency to be Softer or Louder in volume. Turning the knob counter-clockwise forces the slices to be softer. Turning the knob clockwise forces the slices to be louder.  Leaving the knob at the center 12 o'clock position allows slices to play both softer and louder.

It retriggers Slices in the Element very rapidly, which creates an electronic Buzzing effect. The results with Buzz Chaos can be wild, unpredictable and quite wonderful for modern remixes and experimental music.  VIDEO: Watch the &#147;Chaos Buzz&#148; tutorial for ideas for using this unusual feature.  There are five parameters in the Buzz section of the Chaos Designer that determine how often buzz FX are introduced and shape the buzzing for various sonic results:  BUZZ This slider controls the probability of how often a slice from the groove is retriggered with the Buzz effect. Raising the slider causes more slices to be &#147;Buzzed&#148; more frequently. You can think of Zero on this slider as being &#147;Never&#148;, maximum being &#147;Always&#148; and in-between the two extremes are increasing ranges of &#147;Sometimes&#148;.  TIME This knob sets the initial time interval between the retriggers. Since the buzz retriggering happens so rapidly, the faster time settings actually produce a distinct pitch, so the Time knob also controls the tuning at the higher settings. The lowest settings sound more like a fast delay effect with discrete repeats. Turning the knob counter-clockwise retriggers the slices farther apart and lower in pitch. Turning the knob clockwise retriggers the slices closer together and higher in pitch.   SPEED This knob controls the amount and direction of acceleration of the buzz retriggering. You can think of this acceleration effect like dropping a bouncing ball - each successive bounce is faster and faster until they blur together. Speed controls how fast they speed up or slow down, and also the range/distance of acceleration. Turning the knob counter-clockwise slows down the acceleration of successive retriggers and increases the range. Turning the knob clockwise speeds up the acceleration of successive retriggers and increases the range.  Leaving the knob at the center 12 o'clock position turns the acceleration effect OFF, so that you can get a constant rate of retriggering.

Pressing the Capture button while RMX is internally playing creates a MIDI file of the currently playing groove. Capture will round off to the end of the current pass of the loop. It is possible to see if RMX is capturing because it shows &#147;capturing pattern, repeats and dynamics&#148; in the Capture Name Window.    The Capture Tool adds the word &#147;chaos&#148; to the end of the groove name in the MIDI file. This new MIDI file can either be Drag-and-Dropped onto a MIDI track (if the host supports this feature) or Exported as a standard MIDI file (SMF) for use elsewhere.    You can drag-and-drop the new MIDI file by Click-holding on the blue area of the Capture Name Window and dragging the file onto a MIDI track in your host.  You can Export the MIDI file by pressing the EXPORT button. This calls up a Save File dialog box which can be used to save the file to your desired location on your drive.  VIDEO: Please see the host specific tutorials about working with MIDI Files in your host.  Capture Guidelines:  &#149; A Capture cannot occur while RMX is stopped.  &#149; Slice Menu Mode is the only MIDI Mode that can be captured as a MIDI File. While you are able to use the Chaos Designer when in Groove Menu mode, it isn't possible to Capture the complete performance, as there are too many possible events to store in a MIDI File. So we recommend using audio recording/freezing/bouncing in your host for Groove Menu mode Chaos capturing:  VIDEO: Watch the &quot;Capturing Chaos as Audio&quot; tutorial to learn how to do it!  &#149; The Capture Tool stops capturing at the end of the current &#147;pass&#148; of a groove. A &#147;Pass&#148; means &#147;one time through the loop&#148;, so if a groove is one measure long, it stops at the end of the measure. If the groove is 8 bars long, it will stop at the end of playback of the eighth measure of the loop.  &#149; Once the Capture is complete, the groove stops playback automatically to prevent confusion about what was captured. You can be assured that the last pass you hear before playback stops is the final pass in the Captured MIDI file.  &#149; The maximum length that can be captured is the last 16 complete passes of a groove. A &#147;Pass&#148; is the length of the original groove element, so if it is a one measure loop, then 16 measures are the maximum that can be captured, but if the groove is an eight measure loop then the maximum capture amount is 128 measures.            &#149; If you press Capture after 16 passes have already played, then Stylus RMX will reset the capture buffer and begin capturing in the same way for the next 16 passes of the groove.  NOTE: Sometimes it's hard to remember that the Capture tool does not &#147;record&#148; what's about to happen in the future like we are used to, but it &#147;captures&#148; what has already happened in the pastÉ.so it's like historical recording!   &nbsp;");sQ1[89]=new Array("chaos/page08.html","CHAOS DESIGNER - MIDI Input","","CHAOS DESIGNER - MIDI Input  In Slice Menu MIDI mode, Chaos pattern parameters that can be captured in the MIDI file are disabled on MIDI input to enable reliable playback of a captured MIDI file. However, other Chaos parameters can affect incoming MIDI notes from a sequencer track or live-playing from a MIDI keyboard. These parameters include: Reverse, Pitch, Dynamics and Buzz sections.  HINT: The Chaos Designer was developed for use with Groove Elements, but it also works on Sound Menus with these parameters. The results can be quite interesting!  In Groove Menu MIDI mode, Chaos can be used very effectively - especially for introducing variation in an improvised live performance. All Chaos parameters are active in Groove Menu mode. However, none of the Chaos parameters can be captured because there are too many potential MIDI events to capture in a MIDI File.  HINT: Since none of the Chaos parameters can be captured as a MIDI file in Groove Menu MIDI mode, you can freeze, bounce or render your Groove Menu mode performance as an audio file in your host to preserve and keep the variations.

VIDEO: Watch the &quot;FX Page&quot; video tutorial for more information.  FX UNITS The internal RMX FX Units are effect plug-ins that exist within the Stylus RMX plug-in.  There are currently 27 different professional quality internal FX Units to choose from:  &#149; Tube Limiter &#149; Tape Slammer &#149; Modern Compressor &#149; Vintage Compressor &#149; Gate Expander &#149; Imager &#149; Vintage 2-band EQ &#149; Vintage 3-Band EQ &#149; Graphic 7-Band EQ &#149; Graphic 12-Band EQ &#149; Parametric 2-Band EQ &#149; Parametric 3-band EQ &#149; Wah-Wah &#149; Power Filter &#149; Valve Radio &#149; Flame Distortion &#149; PRO-Phaser &#149; EZ-Phaser &#149; Flanger &#149; BPM Delay &#149; BPM Delay X2 &#149; BPM Delay X3 &#149; Retroplex &#149; Radio Delay &#149; Spring Verb &#149; PRO-Verb &#149; EZ-Verb  But can you only use three effects units at a time? Nope! It's actually possible to have a huge number of simultaneous FX Units active at the same time in one instance of Stylus RMX. Any of the FX Units can be put into one of the three slots in an RMX FX Rack -and up to 133 FX Racks can be open at once!  Here's the structure:  1 Insert FX Rack per Edit Group X 16 maximum Edit Groups per part X 8 Parts + 4 Aux FX Racks + 1 Mastering Rack X 3 FX slots per Rack ------------------------- = 399 maximum simultaneous FX Units!   NOTES ON USING THE FX  &#149; Each FX Unit consumes differing amounts of additional CPU power when in use, so the number of simultaneous FX Units depends of the CPU power available in your computer.  &#149; Some FX Units have two pages. The second page parameters can be reached by clicking the arrow on the right side of the plug-in. Usually, it's labeled &#147;MORE&#148; or lists the type of parameter found on the second page.  &#149; You can use external third-party FX plug-ins with Stylus RMX by utilizing the multiple outputs feature of Stylus RMX with your host.  &#149; Although RMX doesn't process external audio inputs, you can still use the RMX FX on your own audio files by creating a REX file of the desired audio and importing it into RMX using the SAGE CONVERTER. Once inside RMX, you can manipulate the audio just as you would any other sound in RMX.

The signal flow of every FX Rack type is in series - feeding the audio from the top slot through the middle slot and then through the bottom slot.  An example of this is illustrated in the picture below:    &#149; In this example, the audio first goes through Flame Distortion FX Unit in the top slot.  &#149; The distorted audio is sent into the EZ-Phaser unit in the middle slot.  &#149; Finally, the distorted and phased audio is sent to the EZ-Verb unit in the bottom slot.   &nbsp;");sQ1[92]=new Array("fx_page/page02.html","FX PAGE - Sub Page Buttons","","FX PAGE - Sub Page Buttons  There are six buttons at the top of the FX page. Each one reveals a sub-page with it's own FX Rack. When first visited, the FX Page defaults to the INSERTS sub-page.   INSERTS RACK PAGE The Insert FX Rack is Part and Edit Group specific; each Part and Edit Group has it's own INSERTS FX Rack. Each time you create a new Edit Group, a new INSERT FX Rack is created just for that Edit Group.  EXAMPLE: Let's say a groove on Part 1 started only with a &#147;Main&#148; Edit Group. At this point, Part 1 would have one INSERT FX Rack. If we assigned &#147;Downbeats&#148; and &#147;Backbeats&#148; to their own Edit Groups, then Part 1 would end up with three INSERT FX Racks. This would allow custom Effects for Downbeats, custom Effects for Backbeats, and custom Effects for all the Slices left in &#147;Main&#148;.  When you switch Parts or Edit Groups, this sub-page displays the FX Rack of the current Part or Edit Group. The audio from a Part or Edit Group is routed through the Insert FX Rack for that Part or Edit Group.  The final output of the Insert FX Rack is routed to the corresponding Part fader on the Mixer Page.  AUX RACK PAGES 1-4 These four sub-pages access the four global Aux FX Racks.            Each Aux FX Rack receives audio from the Mixer Page's Aux send knobs.  EXAMPLE: AUX1 FX Rack receives its input from the AUX1 send knob, etc.  The final output signal from each Aux FX Rack is routed exclusively to Output A.  NOTE: Since Aux effects are global by nature, there is only one Aux FX Rack per Aux Effect sub-page. The Aux FX Racks are not Part or Edit Group specific.  HINT: There are no dedicated Aux returns per se, but you can control the master level of an aux return by lowering the gain of the FX Unit in the lowest slot of the aux rack. If an FX Unit has no gain control, you can insert an Imager FX Unit after it, and that will add many useful controls for adjusting the spatial positioning and the gain like a dedicated Aux Return on a hardware mixer usually does.  REFERENCE: For more information on using Auxes, see the Mixer chapter  MASTER RACK PAGE All audio inside RMX that is routed to Output A is routed through the global Master FX Rack, so it's the ideal place to do overall Mastering-style processing to a whole mix.  NOTE: Since the Master FX Rack is global, there is only one rack and it remains the same regardless of what Part or Edit Group is active. This is why the Edit Group grill covers the Edit Group area when the Master FX sub-page is selected.    &nbsp;");sQ1[93]=new Array("fx_page/page03.html","FX PAGE - Aux Send mini-slider","","FX PAGE - Aux Send mini-slider    This mini-slider controls the gain of the audio signal that the current Edit Group sends through a particular Mixer AUX Send Buss. This audio signal from the output of the mini-slider is routed through the corresponding AUX knobs on the Mixer Page.  The best way to think of this control is as an Aux Send &#147;trim&#148; for each Edit Group before it reaches the Main Aux send knobs on the Mixer page.  EXAMPLE: This allows you to have an Aux Send to a reverb unit only on the Backbeats, and not on the rest of the groove.  This additional Aux Send control is provided here because these AUX Send mini-sliders are Edit Group specific. Each Edit Group has a separate AUX SEND mini-slider on each of the four AUXES. Since there can be up to 16 Edit Groups in a Part, there can be as many as 16 AUX SEND mini-slider trim settings per AUX on each Part.  Whenever a new Edit Group is created, four new AUX SEND mini-sliders are created for the new Edit Group - one on each AUX sub-page. The currently displayed AUX SEND mini-slider position always reflects the value for the current Edit Group on the selected Part.

An Edit Group is a new concept in Stylus RMX that allows you to isolate any individual slice or group of slices of audio and manipulate them completely independently of any other audio inside RMX. Edit Groups are perhaps the most powerful sound-shaping feature inside Stylus RMX. Using them allows you to customize grooves and sounds in a whole new and very flexible way. Although Edit Groups are powerful, they are also very easy to use.  HOW CAN EDIT GROUPS BE USEFUL? Once you starting using Edit Groups, they will become one of your main tools for shaping sounds and grooves in Stylus RMX. They are highly addictive!  Here are just a few examples of the many musical techniques that are possible:  &#149; Isolate all of the snare slices of a groove into one Edit Group and raise the pitch of just the snare slices while leaving the rest of the groove untouched.  &#149; Select any number of slices from a groove and reverse just those slices.  &#149; Quickly and easily select all the downbeats of a groove and Mute them.  &#149; Find three slices in a groove that have a unique sound and Solo them.  &#149; Find Backbeat slices and tune them down while adding a Phaser effect to just those slices.  &#149; Create an Edit Group of all 1/8 notes in a groove and then make those slices pan wildly from side to side along with a Wah Wah effect, leaving the rest of the groove untouched.  &#149; In Sound Menu Mode, you can add a few hits to an Edit Group and tune only those hits while leaving the other hits in the Sound Menu untouched.  &#149; Add slices to an Edit Group that you want to be subjected to the Chaos Designer while leaving the other slices un-Chaosed.  &#149; In Kit Mode, you can assign each of the tom-toms to their own Edit Group and then tune them independently or treat each of them with their own FX.  &#149; While working in Groove Menu mode, you can isolate all the kick drum slices from 25 different grooves into a single Edit Group and treat them with their own FX like Vintage Compressor and Flame Distortion and then solo them.  NOTE: Some of the features in this chapter may be described in an order different than their appearance in menu lists. This is done so that the descriptions follow more of a general workflow with Edit Groups.  VIDEO: Watching the Edit Group video tutorials is highly, highly, HIGHLY recommended! It's often much easier to understand how the Edit Groups work when you can see and hear examples and demonstrations of the principles in action.   &nbsp;");sQ1[126]=new Array("edit_groups/page01.html","EDIT GROUPS - Concepts and Rules","","EDIT GROUPS - Concepts and Rules  VIDEO: Before digging into the Edit Group rules, it is highly recommended that you view the video tutorials on Edit Groups FIRST. They do a great job of introducing this new concept and will provide you with a base of understanding that will help you understand these principles much better.  &#149; An Edit Group begins with at least one slice of audio.  &#149; A slice of audio can only be in one Edit Group at a time.  &#149; Any Edit Group can have slices added to it or removed from it at any time.  &#149; When a new Edit Group is created, all the parameter settings from the Part's &#147;Main&#148; Edit Group are copied to the new one. This includes any FX plug-ins that are active on the Insert FX Rack.  In other words, each time you create an Edit Group, an entirely new Edit Page, Chaos Page, Insert FX Rack and set of 4 AUX SENDS are created just for that Edit Group! All of these pages and parameters can be used to manipulate the audio within the Edit Group independently from all other audio in RMX.  &#149; The Edit Group feature is always active. When a Groove is first loaded, all of the slices in that groove belong to a single Edit Group called &#147;Main&#148;. This allows you to control all of the slices of a Groove at the same time. Once you identify certain slices you wish to treat differently, then you can create new Edit Groups for those slices.  &#149; There is a maximum limit of 16 active Edit Groups per Part. This means that a single Part could have as many as 16 Edit Pages, 16 Chaos Pages, 16 Insert FX Racks and 16 sets of Aux Sends!  &#149; It's possible to create more than 16 Edit Groups, but only 16 of them can be active at a time.  &#149; Edit Groups can work with entire SuitesÑthey are not limited to just picking slices from a single Groove Element. This includes User Favorites Suites. It is possible to pick individual slices from several different Groove Elements within the same Suite, sonically customize them, yet still play all the grooves live from a keyboard in Groove Mode with all the changes intact.  &#149; Edit Groups are not limited to Grooves. They can be used with Sound Menus and Kit Modules as well. Assigning different single hits to different Edit Groups allows you to customize the sounds within a Sound Menu or Kit Module.  &#149; The Edit Group box appears on several RMX pages, but only on those that have parameters that are Edit Group specific.  &#149; For an Edit Group to exist, it must contain at least one slice. If all slices are manually removed, the Edit Group will disappear from the Edit Group list.  NOTE: The &#147;Main&#148; Edit Group is as an exception to this rule, because it always exists.   BASIC EDIT GROUP MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES  &#149; Creation Edit Groups can be created automatically or manually. An Edit Group is created when slices are assigned to it - so the terms &quot;Creation&quot; and &quot;Assignment&quot; are often interchangeable.  &#149; Assignment Slices can be assigned or de-assigned to any Edit Group at any time. Remember that a slice can only be assigned to be a member of one Edit Group at a time.  &#149; Membership When a slice is assigned to an Edit Group, it's considered a &#147;member&#148; of that Edit Group. Membership status is indicated by Bold typeface and can be seen in more detail via the Value Display's &#147;Slice Edit Group&#148; option.  &#149; Selection Clicking an Edit Group name from the drop-down list will select it as the current Edit Group appearing on the Stylus RMX interface for editing.  &#149; Activation Activation means that the parameters of the Edit Group are enabled in the engine. An Edit Group can have slices assigned to it, but not be currently active. You can tell if an Edit Group is active if it has a check mark beside it or not.  REFERENCE: See the Managing Edit Groups and Activation chapters for detailed info.   ASSIGNMENT RULES Slices always follow the most recent Assignment. This means that if the latest Assignment requires a slice that has already been assigned to another Edit Group, the new Edit Group will steal the slice out of the older Edit Group.  EXAMPLE: Let's say there is an Eighth Note (1/8) Edit Group already assigned and then you choose the &#147;Downbeats&#148; Auto-Assign option. Since the slices that fall on downbeats are already in the &#147;1/8&#148; Edit Group, RMX steals the necessary downbeat slices out of &#147;1/8&#148; and places them in the Downbeats Edit Group.   AUDIO ROUTING The Edit Group audio output routing is pre-mixer. This allows Edit Group audio to be routed to an alternate output and not appear in the Mixer Page  NOTE: Edit Group outputs can be used only if your host supports the multiple output feature of software instrument plug-ins.  REFERENCE: See the Outputs chapter for more details.   &nbsp;");sQ1[127]=new Array("edit_groups/page02.html","EDIT GROUPS - The Grill","","EDIT GROUPS - The Grill     EDIT GROUP GRILL When RMX is first opened, the Edit Group editing area is covered by a grill.  For users who wish to only use the MAIN Edit Group, the grill can be left in place and these additional Edit Group features can be ignored. In this case, any change to an Element would affect the whole Element.  EXAMPLE: Changing the Coarse Pitch parameter would always change the pitch of every slice in the Groove.  The Edit Group grill is removed by clicking on the grill itself. Once it has been removed it stays uncovered unless you access an area that does not work with the Edit Group feature.  An example of this would be the MASTER FX sub-page. There are no Master FX parameters that work specifically with each Edit Group, so you will always find the grill covering the Edit Group editing area when visiting that sub-page. Once you return to a page that does work with Edit Groups, like the Chaos Page, the grill disappears on it's own.   EDIT GROUP NAME DISPLAY        This window shows the name of the current active Edit Group. Whatever Edit Group is shown in the display is the active Edit Group on all RMX editing pages for that part. Any parameter that is adjusted will affect the sounds in the Edit Group displayed in this window.   Clicking on the window itself reveals a drop-down menu that allows you to select Edit Groups if multiple Edit Groups currently exist.   The drop-down menu also allows Deactivating and Activating Edit Groups.  REFERENCE: Read the Activation/Deactivation chapter for more info.   SOLO BUTTON  This button solos an Edit Group. It does so by silencing the other Edit Groups on that Part.   MUTE BUTTON  This button mutes an Edit Group. The slices in the muted Edit Group are no longer heard.

Spectrasonics has created these Auto-Assignment choices for quick and easy access to multiple slices at once.

Here's the more detailed explanation with each element type and MIDI Mode:   CREATING AN EDIT GROUP FOR ONE SLICE IN SLICE MENU MODE In Slice Menu MIDI mode, you can quickly create a custom Edit Group that contains one slice.  To do this:  &#149; Start in Slice Menu MIDI mode. &#149; Choose a slice by playing the MIDI note which triggers the desired slice for editing. &#149; Select &#147;CREATE EDIT GROUP (FIRST PLAY A MIDI NOTE)&#148;.  An Edit Group will now be created just for this slice.    Once the new Edit Group is created, it is activated and automatically becomes the current selected Edit Group. It is given the name &#147;Edit Group&#148; with an incremental number.  NOTE: If you forget to play a MIDI note before choosing this menu item, RMX will take the first (lowest) slice of the Groove and use that as the basis for the new Edit Group. RMX does this because an Edit Group MUST have at least one slice in it. If RMX needs to take the first slice of the groove, it will take that slice regardless of what Edit Group it's in. This means that RMX may be stealing the slice from an existing Edit Group.   CREATING AN EDIT GROUP FOR ONE GROOVE IN GROOVE MENU MODE In Groove Menu MIDI mode, you can create a custom Edit Group that contains an entire Groove. To do this:  &#149; Start in Groove Menu MIDI mode. &#149; Choose a Groove by playing the MIDI note which triggers the desired Groove. &#149; Select &#147;CREATE EDIT GROUP (FIRST PLAY A MIDI NOTE)&#148;.  An Edit Group will now be created just for this Groove.   The Groove's name is automatically used as the Edit Group name.  REFERENCE: See the Edit Groups in Groove Menu Mode sub-chapter for more info.   CREATING AN EDIT GROUP FOR ONE SOUND IN A SOUND MENU For Sound Menu Elements, you can quickly create a custom Edit Group that contains one sound.  To do this:  &#149; Select a Sound Menu Element in the Browser &#149; Choose a sound by playing the MIDI note which triggers the desired sound for editing. &#149; Select &#147;CREATE EDIT GROUP (FIRST PLAY A MIDI NOTE)&#148;.  An Edit Group will now be created just for this one sound.   CREATING AN EDIT GROUP FOR ONE MIDI NOTE OF A KIT MODULE For Kit Module Elements, you can quickly create a custom Edit Group that contains one sound.  To do this:  &#149; Select a Kit Module Element in the Browser in Global Kit Mode &#149; Choose a sound by playing the MIDI note which triggers the desired sound for editing. &#149; Select &#147;CREATE EDIT GROUP (FIRST PLAY A MIDI NOTE)&#148;.

The ADD/REMOVE BUTTON allows you to move individual slices from one Edit Group to another. There must be more than one Edit Group for this feature to work. The button itself toggles between ADD and REMOVE depending on whether or not a slice belongs to the currently displayed Edit Group. This button always updates to reflect the status of the currently played slice on the keyboard.  NOTE: This function also works with entire Grooves in Groove Menu MIDI mode and with individual sounds when used with Sound Menu or Kit Module Elements.  &#149; ADD SLICE ADD/SLICE will appear if the most recently played slice is not a member of the currently displayed Edit Group. Clicking this button will Add the slice (or the Groove in Groove Menu MIDI mode) to the Edit Group. Notice that the button instantly updates once it has been pressed to show &#147;Remove&#148; because the slice now belongs to the current Edit Group and can be Removed.  &#149; REMOVE SLICE If the current slice belongs to the selected Edit Group, the button Removes the slice (or the Groove in Groove Menu MIDI mode) from the Edit Group. Removed slices/grooves go back to the &#147;Main&#148; Edit Group. Notice that once the button has been pressed it instantly updates to show &#147;Add&#148;. Since the slice no longer is a member of this Edit Group, it can be added again.  NOTE: If you manually remove all the slices of an Edit Group, the Edit Group disappears entirely from the Edit Group list.  SLICE EDIT GROUP DISPLAY A feature that can aid you while using ADD/REMOVE is the &#147;SLICE EDIT GROUP&#148; option of the Value Display in the Footer. Switching to this mode allows you to see the Edit Group membership of the currently played slice.  In the picture below, you can see that the current Edit Group is custom-named &#147;Crazy Hats&#148;. But the Value Display shows that the currently played slice belongs to the Edit Group &#147;Filtered Snare&#148;. As a result, the ADD/REMOVE button shows &#147;Add&#148; because this slice can be added to &#147;Crazy Hats&#148;.   TIP: Another good technique for using the ADD/REMOVE feature is to use your left hand to select slices on your MIDI Keyboard and use your right hand on the mouse pointed at the ADD/REMOVE SLICE button - and keep your eyes fixed on the ADD/REMOVE button. This makes the process of moving slice assignments around much easier.

Edit Groups work within the structure of an entire Suite; they are not limited to just a single Groove Element. This means that if a Suite is loaded with many different grooves, Edit Groups could be assigned to specific slices of different grooves in that Suite. And if you were in Groove Menu mode, you could play all those grooves live on a keyboard with all the Edit Group customizations intact.  Bold vs. STANDARD TYPEFACE ON EDIT GROUP NAMES  Bold and Standard typeface on an Edit Group's name indicates membership status with regards to the currently displayed Element.  &#149; Bold typeface indicates an Edit Group that contains slices belonging to the currently displayed Element in the Element Name Display.  &#149; Standard typeface indicates that an Edit Group does not contain slices belonging to the currently displayed Element; the standard typeface Edit Group contains slices pertaining to another Element in the Suite.     AUTO-ASSIGNING THE SAME CATEGORY OF SLICES FOR SEVERAL ELEMENTS It is possilble to Auto-Assign a category like &#147;Downbeats&#148; for several Elements in the same Suite. However, only one &#147;Downbeats&#148; Edit Group will appear in the Edit Group list. This single &#147;Downbeats&#148; Edit Group is capable of retaining the Downbeat slices from several Grooves. You can confirm this because the Edit Group remains Bold for each Element whose slices it contains.  If you've already Auto-Assigned the &#147;Downbeats&#148; category of a Groove and would like the downbeats of a second Groove to be in their own separate Edit Group, you can Manually Assign the downbeat slices of the second groove into a custom Edit Group.

In the picture below, &#147;Main&#148; is the active Edit Group; therefore the option is not available.   To Deactivate an Edit Group:  &#149; Choose the Edit Group you want to deactivate &#149; Choose &#147;DEACTIVATE EDIT GROUP&#148;.  Once deactivated, the name of the Edit Group remains in the list without a checkmark.  ACTIVATING AN EDIT GROUP If an Edit Group is not active (no checkmark), it can be Activated by simply selecting it's name in the Edit Group Name Display drop-down menu.  NOTE: Remember that 16 active Edit Groups is the maximum.   WHAT HAPPENS DURING DEACTIVATION?  &#149; All Parameter changes and FX settings that were in place in the Deactivated Edit Group are discarded.  &#149; The slices inside the Edit Group stop being processed by the Edit Group's parameter settings and start being processed by the &#147;Main&#148; Edit Group parameters and FX settings.  &#149; All the slices of the Deactivated Edit Group are still members of that Edit Group. If you use the &#147;Slice Edit Group&#148; feature in the Value Display while playing a keyboard, you'll see that the slices are still assigned to the Deactivated Edit Group.  &#149; The checkmark next to the Edit Group name disappears.   WHAT HAPPENS DURING REACTIVATION?  &#149; The parameters and FX from &#147;Main&#148; are copied onto the Reactivated Edit Group.  &#149; The slices that were being processed by &#147;Main&#148; return to being processed by the reactivated Edit Group's settings.  &#149; A checkmark reappears next to the Edit Group name.

The following Spectrasonics libraries are compatible: (Akai/Roland Groove Control versions only)  &#149; Metamorphosis &#149; BackBeat &#149; Retro Funk &#149; Liquid Grooves &#149; Vocal Planet* &#149; Bizarre Guitar*  NOTE: The Burning Grooves Akai/Roland CD-ROM library versions are NOT compatible with the SAGE Converter, since it is not Groove Control activated.  The following ILIO libraries are compatible: (Akai/Roland Groove Control versions only)  &#149; Big Bad Beats &#149; Ethno Techno &#149; Stark Raving Beats &#149; NoizBox   *SPECIAL NOTE: Vocal Planet and Bizarre Guitar are unique cases in that both of these sample libraries only have a small Groove Control activated section, not the complete library. These two sample libraries are much larger than the small Groove Control sections, and contain many other one-shot samples, phrases and playable multisamples, but you must use a sampler to play the rest of those libraries. Only this small Groove Control part of these two libraries is compatible with the SAGE Converter and Stylus RMX. Vocal Planet will only convert the GC data on the CD-ROM disc that contains that section, so you will notice the conversion going very fast!  After the conversion process is completed, these small sections from VP and Bizarre Guitar will appear in a &#147;Bonus Spectrasonics&#148; directory under EXP Libraries. Note that the same VP/Bizarre Guitar Groove Control material is duplicated on each of the Spectrasonics SAGE Xpanders in the Bonus Spectrasonics.db library (along with many other bonus grooves as well). So if you already have installed a Spectrasonics SAGE Xpander, you don't need to convert Vocal Planet or Bizarre Guitar - since you already have the same material installed.  Other Groove Control¨ Sampler Format discs? If you have purchased any of these libraries in another format like GigaStudio, Kurzweil or SampleCell, please contact Spectrasonics or ILIO about a special accommodation program for you.  Converted Groove Control¨ Libraries vs. SAGE Xpander versions? The SAGE Xpander versions of the CD-ROM titles are essentially the same as a converted CD-ROM title, but the Xpanders also include special Multis for each title and a Bonus Spectrasonics.db or Bonus ILIO.db library. The special multis are available to Groove Control CD-ROM library owners for downloading in the RMX Community area. (but you will need at least one of the Xpanders from each company to get the Bonus Libraries that the multis use)  REFERENCE: Read more in the SAGE Xpanders chapter.   The Conversion Process If you are converting an Akai Groove Control CD-ROM library, choose a library from the drop-down menu under the Akai heading. If you are converting a Roland Groove Control CD-ROM library, choose a library from the drop-down menu under the Roland heading.        Once you have chosen a format and library to convert, a dialog box appears asking you to insert the appropriate disc.   Once you insert the CD-ROM disc, click the OK button and the Converter will begin the conversion process. (Mac OS X will display a warning screen saying that it cannot read the CD-ROM and offers to either Eject or Ignore the disc. Choose &#147;Ignore&#148;.) The red Progress Bar indicates the Converter's degree of completion.   In the case of a multi-disc library like Ethno Techno, the Converter will ask for the necessary disc at the appropriate time.  Once the conversion process is complete, the converted library is ready for use in RMX. You can access any converted Groove Control library by choosing the EXP Libraries Master Directory. The Sound Directory displays the libraries that are available.    Converted libraries are saved to the SAGE/SAGE Libraries/EXP Libraries directory.

(.rx2, .rex or .rcy) &#149; You must have the REX Shared Library installed on your computer before converting. There is a REX Shared Library Installer included in the SAGE Converter application folder, but you can find the latest version here:  http://www.propellerheads.se/download/index.cfm?fuseaction=get_article&amp;article=rexsharedlibrary  &#149; REX Files must be at least one bar in length. Partial bars will not convert properly. &#149; Make sure you set the tempo, time signature and left/right locators correctly in ReCycle before saving the REX File. &#149; Maximum of 61 REX Files per Suite. &#149; If you have more than 92 slices in the REX File, RMX will start the slice MIDI mapping from MIDI note# 0 instead of note# 36. &#149; If you have more than 128 slices, the MIDI File window in the Browser will display an unusual &quot;Use Components&quot; message, which indicates that there are too many slices in the REX file to be translated to a MIDI file. &#149; If you convert a REX file with a time signature of a 6/8, 7/8, 11/8, 12/8, you may notice that it is playing back at double speed in RMX. This is actually not the fault of the Stylus RMX plug-in, but the fact that most hosts use a &#147;quarter note per minute&#148; (QPM) clock instead of a &#147;beats per minute&#148; (BPM) clock. The solution is either to change the clocking resolution of your host to eighth based divisions (which may or may not be possible), or simply press the HALF button in the browser before using the MIDI file.

The files must all reside in the same directory and only one Suite is created during each import.    NOTE: It's not possible to convert folders with this importing method. It is possible to manually select all the REX files within a folder (if there are 61 or less files), but not the actual folder itself.  NOTE: 61 REX files per Suite is the maximum allowed.

Importing using this method is a simple matter of selecting the desired files or folders and dragging them onto the SAGE Converter GUI. The conversion process begins once the mouse button is released.  Before importing with Drag-and-Drop, there are a few guidelines to keep in mind:  &#149; 61 REX Files is the limit for each Suite/Folder.  &#149; You can only convert one level of sub-folders in any single REX Library.

You can select one or more REX files (up to 61) and drag-and-drop them directly onto the SAGE Converter interface. This results in a single Suite being created which is automatically placed in the &#147;Converted REX Files&#148; Sound Directory. This new method is a faster alternative to using the &#147;Import REX Files&#148; button.   Once the files have been drag-and-dropped on the SAGE Converter interface, a window appears asking you to name the Suite that will contain the imported REX Files.   After you are finished naming the new suite, you may click the &#147;Convert&#148; box with the mouse button, or press &#147;Enter&#148; on your computer keyboard.

If you are only importing a few REX files, the process will only take a couple seconds.  Once the SAGE Converter has completed the importing, the Suite is ready the next time you open the RMX plug-in. The converted REX files may be accessed via the &#148;Converted REX Files&#148; Sound Directory under the User Libraries Master Directory.   NOTE: It is possible to reorganize Suites once they have been imported. Please see the section on Organizing User Libraries for information on how to manage imported Suites. REFERENCE: If you are having any trouble with unsuccessful conversions, please read the Troubleshooting chapter in the Support section.    Batch Converting a Single Folder of REX Files-&gt;Single RMX Suite A single folder containing up to 61 REX files may be drag-and-dropped on the Converter GUI for import. Using this method results in one Suite being placed in the &#147;Converted REX Files&#148; Sound Directory. The Suite is automatically given the same name as the folder containing the REX files. This is a great way to quickly import a bunch of files that are already in a folder.   Once the Converter has completed the import, the Suite is ready the next time you open the RMX plug-in. The converted REX files may be accessed via the &#148;Converted REX Files&#148; Sound Directory.   NOTE: It is possible to reorganize Suites once they have been imported.

Batch Converting Multiple Folders of REX Files-&gt;Multiple RMX Suites Several folders of grooves may be imported at the same timeÑeach folder becoming its own Suite in the &#147;Converted REX Files&#148; Sound Directory. Each folder may contain up to 61 REX files.  In the picture below, there are four folders with unrelated REX files. We can import them into their own Suites during a single Batch conversion.   Importing is as simple as selecting all four folders and Drag-and-Dropping them at the same time onto the SAGE Converter GUI.   The result of the batch conversion can be seen in the picture below. There are now four Suites inside the &#147;Converted REX Files&#148; Sound Directory that have the same names as the four folders that were dragged to the GUI.   NOTE: It is possible to reorganize Suites once they have been imported. Please see the section on Organizing User Libraries for information on how to manage imported Suites. REFERENCE: If you are having any trouble with unsuccessful conversions, please read the Troubleshooting chapter in the Support section.  Batch Converting a Single REX Library-&gt;Single RMX User Sound Directory The SAGE Converter is capable of importing an entire library of REX files at once. This allows you to convert hundreds of files at the same time. Batch library conversion involves simply drag-and-dropping a directory that contains REX files organized in sub-directories. In the example below, the directory &#147;REX Library 1&#148; contains an entire library of REX Files. All the REX Files are contained in the three sub-directoriesÑRex Suite 1, Rex Suite 2 and Rex Suite 3. Each sub-directory can have up to 61 REX files.   NOTE: The Converter only looks one sub-directory level down from the top level for REX files. If a sub-directory contains more sub-directories with REX Files, the Converter will not see those REX Files.   To batch convert the entire REX library, drag-and-drop the &#147;REX Library 1&#148; folder onto the SAGE Converter's interface.   Once the conversion is complete, a new Sound Directory has been createdÑ&#147;REX Library 1&#148;. This is exactly the same as the library's original name. All of the associated files with that library are in this new Sound Directory. There are three Suites in this Sound Directory. They are: Rex Suite 1, Rex Suite 2 and Rex Suite 3Ñexactly the same as the sub-directories. The REX files that were in those sub-directories are now RMX Elements within those Suites.  NOTE: It is possible to reorganize Suites and libraries once they have been imported. Please see the section on Organizing User Libraries for information on how to manage imported Suites. REFERENCE: If you are having any trouble with unsuccessful conversions, please read the Troubleshooting chapter in the Support section.   Batch Converting Multiple REX Libraries-&gt;Multiple RMX User Sound Directories The SAGE Converter is capable of importing multiple complete libraries of REX files at the same time. Each library will become its own Sound Directory. In the example below, there are two libraries ready for batch conversion. Note that each library has several sub-directories, but only one sub-directory level deep. The batch library conversion begins when both libraries' top level folders are drag-and-dropped onto the SAGE Converter's GUI.   The result of the batch conversion is that each library became a Sound Directory and each of the Sub-directories became a Suite within the corresponding Sound Directory.   NOTE: It is possible to reorganize Suites and libraries once they have been imported. Please see the section on Organizing User Libraries for information on how to manage imported Suites. REFERENCE: If you are having any trouble with unsuccessful conversions, please read the Troubleshooting chapter in the Support section.   Special Batch Combination Conversions Generally, it is recommended that you organize files for importing as described in the previous sections. However, the SAGE Converter is very flexible and can handle multiple kinds of imports simultaneously. Basically, any combinations of files, folders and libraries will result in a successful conversion. Just remember that files and folders of files always end up in the &#147;Converted REX Files&#148; Sound Directory and Libraries with nested sub-directories will become new Sound Directories.   To summarize the batch conversion rules:  &#149; Multiple REX Files-&gt;Single RMX Suite  &#149; Single Folder of REX Files-&gt;Single RMX Suite  &#149; Multiple Folders of REX Files-&gt;Multiple RMX Suites  &#149; Single REX Library-&gt;Single RMX User Sound Directory  &#149; Multiple REX Libraries-&gt;Multiple RMX User Sound Directories   &nbsp;");sQ1[144]=new Array("converter/page06.html","SAGE CONVERTER - Organizing User Libraries","","SAGE CONVERTER - Organizing User Libraries   Once REX Files have been imported, you can reorganize the Suites and Sound Directories for more convenient access in several different ways. It's possible to:  &#149; Create new Sound Directories. &#149; Move Suites from one Sound Directory to another. &#149; Rename or Delete existing Sound Directories. &#149; Rename or Delete existing Suites  IMPORTANT NOTE: You MUST NOT move, delete or rename Elements within a Suite on your computer. Doing so will break the Suite. Please see the end of this chapter for information about how to manage Elements properly.  All of this management takes place in the SAGE/SAGE Libraries/User Libraries directory on your computer. You don't perform any of these functions from the RMX GUI.  The above directory looks like this in RMX:   In the following explanations, we'll use the above directory as a starting point.  NOTE: To view any of the following changes inside RMX, you must remove any active instance of RMX and then reopen it. RMX will then rescan the directories and reflect all the directory changes.  CREATING A NEW SOUND DIRECTORY Creating a new Sound Directory is very easy. Simply create a new folder in the User Libraries directory and give it a custom name. For a Sound Directory to appear in the Sound Directory menu, it must have at least one valid Suite. If there is something wrong with the Suite, you will not be able to select the Sound Directory.  In this example, a new Sound Directory called &#147;Action Grooves&#148; has been created. However, since it is still empty, it will not appear yet in RMX:   MOVING SUITES FROM ONE SOUND DIRECTORY TO ANOTHER Suites must reside in a Sound Directory, they cannot function on their own. Moving a Suite from one Sound Directory to another simply requires moving the desired folders from one Sound Directory to another.  In the example below, the Suites &#147;Rundown 155&#148; and &#147;SLASHER 185&#148; have been moved to the &#147;Action Grooves&#148; Sound Directory:    This is how these changes appear in Stylus RMX:   NOTE: To make a Suite into its own Sound Directory, you must create a Sound Directory first and then move the Suite into it. Simply moving a Suite one directory level up will not work because the directory structure for the Sound Directory will not be correct.  RENAMING EXISTING SOUND DIRECTORIES Giving a Sound Directory a new name is accomplished by renaming the folder. It is possible to rename any User imported Sound DirectoryÑincluding &#147;Converted REX Files&#148;. Let's rename &#147;Converted REX Files&#148;.  In the example, you can see that we have renamed &#147;Converted REX Files&#148; to &#147;Slow and Funky&#148;:   Here's what that change looks like in RMX:   When you perform future conversions, RMX will automatically create another &#147;Converted REX Files&#148; Sound Directory if necessary. You can always rename that one too.  RENAMING EXISTING SUITES Giving a Suite a new name is accomplished by renaming the folder. It is possible to rename any User imported Suite. Let's rename the two Suites inside the &#147;Slow and Funky&#148; Sound Directory.  In the picture below, you can see that we have renamed both Suites:   Here's how they appear in RMX now:     DELETING EXISTING IMPORTED SUITES AND SOUND DIRECTORIES You can delete converted Suites and Sound Directories by simply trashing them on your computer.  However, DON'T delete individual Elements! This will break the Suite and cause problems. See the next section on the correct way to manage Elements.   DELETING, RENAMING, MOVING &amp; UPDATING IMPORTED ELEMENTS While it's not possible to do these functions using your computer's file management system without causing problems - there is another way to accomplish all of these functions at the Element level:  Simply do what you need to do to the original REX files, delete the previously imported Suites or Sound Directory in the SAGE folder and re-import the REX files again. The import process is extremely fast - especially with the batch conversion methods - so it's not hard and doesn't take as much time as you might imagine.  HINT: We highly recommend keeping your original REX files handy, even after you've converted them to RMXÉsince you may wish to convert them again for any of these element management reasons.   &nbsp;");sQ1[145]=new Array("converter/page07.html","SAGE CONVERTER - Menu Items","","SAGE CONVERTER - Menu Items   ABOUT SAGE CONVERTER This menu item displays the software version number of the SAGE Converter.

You MUST have the extension .rx2, .rex or .rcy for a successful conversion. However, if you're importing many files and one or more of them is not named correctly, the properly named files will be converted, but the misnamed file will be ignored and no warning given.  NOTE: The converter will attempt to convert anything with an rx2 file extension. If a file is not a REX file, but has an rx2 extension, the Converter will look like it imported the file, but ultimately it will not show up in RMX.   &#149; TOO MANY REX FILES   If you try to convert more than 61 files in any folder, a warning will appear and prevent any conversions from happening.  &#149; NAME MUST BE 31 CHARACTERS OR LESS If you attempt to name a Suite with more than 31 characters, when you press &#147;Enter&#148; the name becomes highlighted and the naming window waits for you to rename the file.  &#149; A VALID SAGE FOLDER MUST EXIST A valid SAGE folder must exist when converting.

There is nothing run-of-the-mill about the quality of these performances, and there is a great variety of them, from basic 'Billie Jean'-type pop to highly-intricate shuffle, the latter capturing every nuance of snare stroke with great subtlety...The benefits of the Groove Control technique are considerable, allowing easy tempo changing without affecting timbre, and the power to create groove-quantize templates to use elsewhere in your track...I suspect that a staggering amount of time has gone into its presentation on Backbeat, to ensure that the grooves maintain their integrity...If you have a need for exceptionally well recorded standard drum grooves that really do groove, this is a library you should audition. Added to Retro Funk, it contributes to an extensive library of formidable grooves.&quot; - Sound on Sound 5 star review  &quot;Backbeat is most certainly a classic-style drum loop collection that is a cut above the rest. The variety and quality of all of the loops is first rate and very professional sounding, rivaling anything that you'll hear in any number of high-profile pop or rock tracks. The performances are also extremely tight and dynamic - they have life, and perform flawlessly...if you're looking for loops with an acoustic &quot;classic rock and pop&quot; feel, Backbeat is a library that you should own....For $99, Backbeat is as close as many of us will get to having four really great drummers performing at our command.&quot; - Sonic Control 5 start review  &#147;Backbeat answers &#147;Hey, what about acoustic drums?&#148; with its rock solid, tight, realistic drum grooves. It's possible to assemble realistic, customized, evolving drum parts. Also, the grooves result from four different drummers working in four different studios, so you're not locked into one particular soundÉIf you do music for a living and work in multiple styles, you'll have a hard time not wanting all of these Xpanders. All of them are equally excellent additions to Stylus RMX, and take an already fine instrument even further.&#148; - Craig Anderton, Keyboard Magazine   BackBeat SAGE Xpander Complete Directory:

Variety &#149; Special Bonus Spectrasonics.db includes grooves from   Bizarre Guitar, Vocal Planet, Distorted Reality and more!  Killer variety and groove factor from the same team of talent behind BackBeat. Presented in the same song construction format as BackBeat, but with a dryer and more classic sound of vintage drums and recording techniques. The Retro Funk SAGE Xpander is very versatile in many styles (not only Funk and Soul) and works incredibly well with the Chaos Designer!

The featured players include: Gregg Bissonette (Santana, Joe Satriani, Don Henley) Bob Wilson (Liquid Grooves, George Benson, The Crusaders) John Ferraro (Larry Carlton, David Benoit, Albert Lee, Aaron Neville) Eric Boseman (Liquid Grooves, James Newton-Howard)  If you're a fan of classic live drumming like BackBeat... Retrofunk is the essential companion!  FIND OUT MORE AND LISTEN TO THE DEMOS ON OUR SITE!  Review Quotes:  &quot;This is a release that deals in sheer quality. Top LA session drummers focusing on laid-back and super-cool funk drumming...more than enough authentically '70s drumming sounds and styles to keep retro-heads happy. Provides all the flavor and spirit of retro soul/funk while at the same time fusing it with a 'must-sample' sound quality and an infectiously musical groove. There is a fantastically wide range of drum sounds used in the grooves...amazingly tight and powerful funk-rock kit sounds that would give even hard rockers a run for their money...Ultimately, Retrofunk's flair, precision, musicianship and sheer usefulness certainly rate it as one of the best drumming discs.&#148; - Sound on Sound 5 Star review  &#147;Featuring the same red-hot players as its sister title Backbeat, Retro Funk is aimed at Stylus RMX owners looking to bring a bit of bonafide 'human' groove to their tracks. The feel throughout is righteously funky (although you wouldn't necessarily call everything here funk, if that makes sense)Égrooves galore, fills of varying lengths, percussion parts, claps, multitrack combinations that really take advantage of the RMX engine, and plenty more to keep the studio funkateer busy. Yet another feather in Stylus' already festooned cap&#148; - Computer Music magazine  &#147;Retro Funk, takes you right back to the Ô70s. These beats completely funk out in the Harvey Mason/Mike Clark Headhunters East Bay vein. Some of the patterns groove so well it drives you crazy! Funky funky.&#148; - Virtual Instruments magazine   Retro Funk SAGE Xpander Complete Directory:  Multi Patches  060-079 BPM 061-Roles 061-Slow Flo 065-Locus Focus 069-Investigation 070-Draggin Along

Review Quotes:  &quot;Sampling's finest hour....A masterpiece of layering, effecting and processing...a hugely atmospheric feel...the rhythms are musically useful, and virtually all of them spark compositional ideas...all the elements of every full mix and remix are available individually to give the user maximum flexibility...Eric Persing at his creative best..&quot; - Sound on Sound 5 Star review  &quot;...Truly inspiring...expertly performed and recorded, and the sound quality is uniformly excellent...The basic grooves are very interesting...The heavily effected versions are striking in their attitude and atmosphere. ...producer Eric Persing has outdone himself with creative processing...Although all of the loops start out as acoustic performances, by the time he has finished with the remix variations they're perfect for trip-hop, lo-fi, or acid jazz tracks...good use of the Korg Wavedrum; perfect for the other-worldly vibe of this disc...Musical, grooving, clever ... aw, these loops just plain sound great...played right in the pocket..the recording quality and performances are first-class...If these loops don't inspire you, hang it up.&quot; - Keyboard Magazine  &#147;Liquid Grooves flat-out delights me. It's vaguely ethnic, with percussive, surreal grooves; this is what they should have used for the Zion party scenes in the Matrix flicks. Think also Peter Gabriel at his most adventurousÉfor me, this is a highlight of the SAGE Xpander seriesÉThere's no denying that the five SAGE Xpanders (Backbeat, Retro Funk, Liquid Grooves, Burning Grooves, and Metamorphosis) bring an embarrassment of riches to the Stylus RMX platform.&#148; - Craig Anderton  &#147;Liquid Grooves is simply Outstanding.&#148; - Virtual Instruments magazine

Review Quotes: &quot;A slammin' combination of loops....Sizzling cymbals and punchy drums are the name of the game...not just natural sounds...I would definitely use these grooves not only because the playing is good, but because I like the modern sound design....top honors for providing one new mix after another...killer beats throughout...Rock-solid playing...Excellent.&quot; - Keyboard 5 star review &quot;Libraries like Burning Grooves have raised the standard of drumming collections so highly that in order to make their mark these days drumming libraries have to offer more than just expert solo drum performances...The quality of both the playing and recording is first class...the rhythms are straight 'on-the-money', and very usable...they sound extremely natural with an impressive degree of dynamic responsiveness.&quot; - Sound on Sound review &#147;These beats all use standard drum set, but the effects and sounds are all different and all very interesting. These beats are all quite original, and due to dynamics, even the really busy ones groove like crazy. If you never used it, this expander would be worth having just as a source for drum programming ideas.&#148; - Virtual Instruments magazine &#147;The evil twin to Backbeat, dripping energy and assertiveness, although there are also tighter/more polite groovesÉIf you do music for a living and work in multiple styles, you'll have a hard time not wanting all of these Xpanders. All of them are equally excellent additions to Stylus RMX, and take an already fine instrument even further.&#148; - Craig Anderton &quot;The collection will appeal to just about anyone who is looking to add a live drum loop to a track, the extra processing that the collection has undergone adds an extra element of interest, but without drifting too far from the core theme. Thoroughly recommended.&quot; - Sounduser.com review   Burning Grooves SAGE Xpander Complete Directory:  Multi Patches  050-079 BPM 058-Chunky Barking 060-Slurp-n-Slam 062-Cork Regiment 069-Lows on

Review Quotes: &quot;Persing has done it again... hundreds of remix grooves ranging from airy, pulsing blobs to woofer-wrenching club destroyers. If you're looking for cutting-edge remixology, check out Metamorphosis!&quot; - Harmony Central &quot;Hot Pick&quot; award &quot;Amazing, description-defying sounds on this bases-loaded, outta-the-park home run collection...scandalously creative sound design...everything from sizzling electronic and ethnic-sounding percussion loops to gut-busting kicks that thump out of the speakers with all the angst of an Outkast cut. The sound quality is top-notch throughout...The loops are not only impressive from a production standpoint, they're incredibly musical and inspirational, which is why we've given Metamorphosis a Key Buy.&quot; - Keyboard Magazine Key Buy award review &quot;We are already TOTALLY digging Metamorphosis!&quot; - Mark Isham (film composer, recording artist) &quot;There's far more here than just a collection of gritty, scratchy old funk rhythms with a slight swing. There's distortion, filtering, extreme effects and synthesized sound Ñ the list of gear used in the creation of the samples extends to two pages of hardware and software. This is not a night out with an HR16 and a Quadraverb! The degree and type of processing varies enormously throughout the library, but at no point are the loops rendered unusable through over-zealous mangling. The loops really groove nicely, while the processing gives them character and depth that would be very hard to find from any other source.&quot; - Sound on Sound magazine Five Star review &quot;The important thing about Metamorphosis is that the loops work, they sound fantastic and if used properly, they don't overwhelm. Metamorphosis is another superb effort by the Spectrasonics team that should most certainly be in any electronic composers' creative sound palette.&quot; - Sonic Control Five Star review  &quot;Absolutely brilliant...I was looking for some loop-based material to make a song backing track more dramatic and interesting. Within 10 minutes of working with 'Metamorphosis', I'd found three or four loops that exactly fitted the bill. After an hour, I'd found so much useable material that my mind was beginning to boggle! I really like the way Eric Persing uses distortion and phasing, but somehow manages to maintain the loop's sonic integrity. The end result is exactly to my taste, powerful without being overpowering, funky without being clichd. I don't know exactly how he does it, but I do know it would take me weeks to get anywhere near the same effect! My congratulations for making the world of sampling inspirational again.&quot; - English keyboard legend Dave Stewart &quot;Persing has set the standard for how groove libraries should be done....Inspiring.&quot; - Bruce Richardson, Pro-Rec web site   Metamorphosis SAGE Xpander Complete Directory:  Multi Patches  050-069 BPM 050-Primera 060-Hurry Up 060-Rugged Terrain

Array("xpanders/page07.html","SAGE XPANDERS - FAQs","","SAGE XPANDERS - FAQs  What is a S.A.G.E. Xpander and how is it different from other loop libraries?  A SAGE Xpanderª is fully Groove Control¨ activated official expansion library for Stylus RMX and is designed specifically to work in Stylus RMX. It's very simple to install and works immediately with Stylus RMX in the Browser's Expansion Libraries directory. Audio loop sample CDs must first be sliced in ReCycle as a REX file before they can be used in RMX.  REFERENCE: For more info, read the Groove Control and Importing Audio chapters.  Where can I buy the SAGE Xpanders? Can I order them through Spectrasonics? The Spectrasonics SAGE Xpanders are all available now exclusively from authorized Spectrasonics dealers and International distributors. We don't sell them direct on our site.  Contact ILIO for information on the availability of their SAGE Xpander titles.  If I already have the CD-ROM version of a title, do I need the SAGE Xpander version? Not if the CD-ROM is Groove Control activated. If it is, you can simply convert it with the SAGE Converter and then download the multis in the RMX Community area of our site.  NOTE: Although Burning Grooves has been available as a loop/kit CD-ROM sample library, there was never a Groove Control¨ activated CD-ROM version of it. Even if you have all of the original Spectrasonics CD-ROM libraries, we'd recommend the SAGE Xpander version of this title, since it also contains a lot of new material and it will give you access to the Bonus Spectrasonics.db library - which is quite useful!  What's are the differences between the original Groove Control CD-ROM library version and the SAGE Xpander version of the same title? The Groove Control sections are basically the same on both, but the Xpander version also contains an additional Bonus Spectrasonics.db or Bonus ILIO.db library and a library of new RMX multi patches that are unique for each Xpander title.  Groove Control CD-ROM users may download the Xpander multi patches to use after converting the CD-ROM title from the RMX Community area.  NOTE: CD-ROM users should have at least one of the Xpanders for full compatibility, since the new multi patches utilize the Bonus Libraries.  There may also be substantial portions of the original library that are multisamples and not Groove Control activated, and therefore do not convert into RMX or appear on the Xpander. Vocal Planet and the Burning Grooves &#147;Smoking Kits&#148; are both examples of this.  If I have the Xpander version do I need the CD-ROM version? Not unless the original library has significant Multisample sections that are not Groove Control loops. This would certainly apply to Bizarre Guitar, Vocal Planet and the Burning Grooves Kits.  Is the Bonus section the same on each of the SAGE Xpanders? The Spectrasonics titles all have the same Bonus Spectrasonics.db library. The ILIO titles all have the same Bonus ILIO.db library. Each Xpander title has a unique library of Multi patches.  Is there an upgrade from the Groove Control CD-ROM to the SAGE Xpander version? It isn't necessary, since they are essentially the same. We've made it so that you can use your existing Groove Control CD-ROM version with the SAGE Converter utility and download the special Multi patches in the RMX Community area.  I noticed that there are no new Kits or Kit Modules when I installed a SAGE Xpander. That's correct. All of the SAGE Xpanders contain mainly Groove Elements with some additional Sound Menus and all of the new multi patches for each title. The SAGE Xpanders are primarily designed as Groove expanders.  Is there any way to make kits from a SAGE Xpander? No. But you can always play the slices of any Groove Element to make your own patterns.  Can other third party developers make SAGE Xpanders? Not without a special arrangement with Spectrasonics. A SAGE Xpander is officially Groove Control¨ activated, which means a higher level of quality than simply converting a REX library and repackaging it.  REFERENCE: Read the Groove Control¨ chapter for more info.  Are there any new SAGE Xpanders on the horizon? You'll have to wait and see!

TROUBLESHOOTING FAQs - Installation issues  When I open RMX, there are no Directories available. What's wrong? If you cannot see the sound library from the Stylus RMX Browser, this is an indication of one of two possible problems:  1. The SAGE folder is not in the right location.  2. The contents of the SAGE folder are incomplete.  The Spectrasonics folder must contain a folder named &#147;SAGE&#148;. This SAGE may be either a complete SAGE folder or a shortcut/alias to a complete SAGE folder.  For Windows users, the Spectrasonics folder is located in the Program Files folder. For Mac users, the Spectrasonics folder is located in the &lt;user&gt;/Library/Application Support folder.  You also need to verify that the contents of the Core Library folder are complete within SAGE/Stylus RMX/. All the Contents need to be installed, which will result in fourteen &#147;.db&#148; files and one &#147;order.txt&#148; file within the Core Library folder. The WatchMe video that is included on RMX Disc 1 provides detailed instruction on how to properly install the files from the discs to your hard drive.  Version 1.0-1.2 of Stylus RMX had eight .db files. Version 1.5 increased the number to 14 .db files.  To verify that your SAGE folder is complete, make sure the Stylus RMX/Core Library folder has all fourteen.db files and one order.txt file.  Your SAGE Folder contents should look like this after a full installation:    NOTE: Non-US versions of Windows may use a different name for the &#147;Program&#148; directory (Programme, etc)  How do I move my SAGE folder to an external drive? On Windows, move the SAGE folder from your Spectrasonics folder to the desired location. Make a shortcut to the SAGE folder and put that shortcut in the Spectrasonics folder. Rename the shortcut to &#147;SAGE&#148;.  On the Mac, move the SAGE folder from your Spectrasonics folder located at &lt;user&gt;/Library/Application Support/Spectrasonics to the desired location. Make an alias to the SAGE folder and put that alias in the Spectrasonics folder. Rename the alias to &#147;SAGE&#148;. REFERENCE: Read the Moving the SAGE Directory chapter for more info. MAC: The RMX OSX DVD Installer starts up OS 9/Classic Mode, what should I do? On some Mac systems, this can happen with the DVD installers. If Classic Mode starts up when running the installer for Stylus RMX from either Disc 1 or 2, you can work around this by dragging the OSX folder from the DVD to the desktop and running the installer from the desktop.  &nbsp;");sQ1[158]=new Array("support/version/index.html","SUPPORT - Software Version History version 1","","SUPPORT - Software Version History version 1.5  Stylus RMX 1.5.1 Release Notes  &#149; New Feature: Recent Sound Directories Pop-Up Menu You can now view the directories that you have recently visited by right-clicking anywhere in the Browser window.

Since this plug-in standard is native to OS X - and not to any specific host or platform (like TDM or VST) - Apple has encouraged companies to adopt it as a standard for all Mac audio applications. Although it is not cross-platform, many host applications like Logic, GarageBand, Digital Performer, Abelton Live and others have adopted the Audio Unit plug-in standard.  AU Abbreviation for Audio Unit  AUX Send An alternate variable audio output used to send a signal to a dedicated FX rack for additional FX processing. In RMX, there are four AUX Sends per Part on the Mixer Page. They route audio to corresponding AUX FX racks. For example, Aux Send knob 1 routes audio to AUX FX rack 1, etc. AUX Send knobs control the volume sent to the AUX FX racks. More...  AUX Return An AUX Return routes audio from an AUX FX Rack directly to Output A--the Master Fader. More...  Automation As you manipulate controls on the RMX interface, the host's automation records these movements and plays them back. These recorded movements can also be edited from inside the host application. You may also use a hardware control surface to manipulate some of RMX's parameters as well. More...  Bar A vertical line on a musical staff that indicates the beginning or end of a measure. Synonymous with measure.  Bi-polar control This kind of control has more than one function within its movement range. Usually, there is a center detent position where the control is off. Moving one direction from the detent position activates one function and moving the other way from the detent position activates a different function. The Master Filter on the Edit Page is an example of this: in the center position, the filter is off. Moving the slider to the left of the center detent position activates a Low Pass Filter. Moving the same slider to the right of the center detent activates a High Pass Filter.  Browser The area of RMX that offers access to all of the audio libraries of sounds and grooves. More...  Buss A path which routes audio from one or more sources to a particular destination.  Bypass Disengaging an FX Unit so that it no longer affects the audio. Doing this saves CPU power. More...  Clone To duplicate - Used in MIDI learn terminology. Duplicates the current set of MIDI Learn parameters from Part 1 to Parts 2-8. This is a great time saver when setting up an external hardware MIDI controller. You can set up Part 1 with all the MIDI Learn parameters you like, then clone Part one to all the other Parts. More...  Cycle One Cycle has been completed when something runs from its start point to its end point. This can refer to things like grooves or LFO waveforms.  Column A vertical list of available choices in the Browser. More...  Combo Groove A multitrack groove that plays several audio sub-components simultaneously. In a MIDI File, Combo Grooves will have more than one tier of MIDI notes playing at a time. Not all grooves with the word &#147;Combo&#148; in them used this multitrack playback technique.  Compressor/Limiter A device for reducing the effective dynamic range of an input signal by preventing it from rapidly exceeding or falling below a selected amplitude threshold. The first part of a compander, it is used to make loud parts of a signal softer and soft parts louder. Beyond the threshold, the ratio of the signal's input level to its output level (e.g., 2:1, 4:1) is user-selectable. A compressor is commonly used to keep levels within an acceptable range, but because it can slow a signal's rate of decay below the threshold, compressors are also used to add sustain to instruments such as electric guitar and bass. The limiter acts like a compressor, but operates only at the top end of the dynamic range. The limiter has a faster attack time (1µs to 1ms) than the compressor alone (1ms to 10ms). A compressor/limiter is traditionally inserted between the outputs of a device and the inputs of the mixer or mastering recorder. More...  Center detent This is the neutral position of a parameter's knob or slider, especially in reference to bi-polar controls. When in this position, the function is disengaged and does not affect anything.  Defaults These are predetermined settings that RMX recalls when it is first instantiated, cleared, reverted, or when a global mode is changed. Spectrasonics provides factory defaults, but you can replace them with your own settings. More...  Directory Used in reference to a folder on the computer's drive. More...  Drop-down menu One of these menu lists appears when you click on an RMX display window with a downward arrow. Once you click on the appropriate window, a menu appears to &#147;drop down&#148;. Once the menu list appears, you can select an option in the menu with the mouse. Synonymous with pop-up menu.  DSP Digital Signal Processing - refers to the manipulation of digital audio in a computer. The more processing you would like to do, the faster and more powerful computer you need.  Edit Group One or more Slices, Grooves or Sounds that can be isolated and treated independently in RMX.  Edit Group Creation Edit Groups can be created automatically or manually. An Edit Group is created when slices are assigned to it - so the terms &quot;Creation&quot; and &quot;Assignement&quot; are often interchangeable.  Edit Group Assignment The process of moving Slices from one Edit Group to another. There are two types of assignments: Auto-Assigns and Manual Assigns.  Edit Group Membership When a slice is assigned to an Edit Group, it&rsquo;s considered a &ldquo;member&rdquo; of that Edit Group. Membership status is indicated by Bold typeface and can be seen in more detail via the Value Display&rsquo;s &ldquo;Slice Edit Group&rdquo; option.  Edit Group Selection The process of choosing an Edit Group so that you may work with it, by clicking on its name. Selecting an Edit Group will automatically activate it.  Edit Group Activation Turning an edit group &#147;ON&#148;. Edit Groups can be assigned without activating them. Selecting an Edit group activates it. Edit Groups can also be de-activated without losing the slice assignments. RMX can have a total of 16 activated Edit Groups simultaneously per part, but there is no limit to how many can be assigned or created. A check mark indicates an active Edit Group.  Elements The audio sound files of the SAGE format, which also include key mapping and timing information. An Element can be a Groove, a Sound Menu, or a Kit Module. Elements are always contained and presented within a Suite. More...  Engine The core software code that structures the operation of audio functions in a plug-in. The engine developed by Spectrasonics that is responsible for running Stylus RMX is S.A.G.E. - The Spectrasonics Advance Groove Engine. More...  Expander (1) A signal processing device which is the inverse of a compressor, providing the gradual attenuation of signals that fall below a user-defined threshold. This process, known as expansion, reduces background noise and at the same time increases the dynamic range of the input signal. (2) A SAGE Xpander is an optional add-on library to Stylus RMX. More...  Fader A controller in the form of a slider that usually affects the loudness/softness of audio levels. Placing a fader at Unity or 0 gain means that the audio channel is outputting the same audio level as was input to the channel. Most faders allow you to make the volume louder and softer than the originally input signal. Also used to refer to any type of slider. Synonymous with Slider. More...  Folders/Sub-Folders An organizational tool on a computer that allows grouping of files. Also known as a Directory. A sub-folder is a folder inside another folder. Also known as a sub-directory.  Footer The section at the bottom of the RMX GUI that always remains constant no matter what RMX Page you're currently working on. More...  FX Slot An area where an FX Unit can be loaded. There are three FX Slots per FX Rack. More...  FX Unit An FX Unit is an internal RMX software signal processing plug-in which gets loaded into an FX Slot.  Each FX Unit is a real-time sound processor. Currently, there are 27 FX Units in Stylus RMX. More...  FX Rack The area designated to load FX Units. An FX Rack consists of three FX Slots. More...  FX Parameter Any knob, slider, drop-down menu or button that a user can select and adjust. The result is a change in the sound passing through the FX Unit (unless it is bypassed).

For example, Multi and Kit Modes -- each mode is global because RMX must be in one mode or the other. More...  Groove An audio loop track that usually involves percussive sounds, but can also be a tonal audio loop. Synonymous with Loop. A groove element is usually between one and eight measures long.  Groove Control¨ (GC) A proprietary sound development method for sliced audio - introduced by Spectrasonics - involving cutting a groove into Slices of audio based on the rhythmic content at the best possible sound quality for various types of audio sources. This allows you to change the tempo of the groove, but not the pitchÑwith results that are of higher sound quality than other methods of tempo change. Spectrasonics has developed many techniques to ensure that every Groove Control¨ product adheres to strict standards. As a result, GC grooves can be played at MANY different tempos and keep a high standard of audio quality. Only Spectrasonics and ILIO Entertainments are licensed to produce Groove Control products. More...  Groove Control¨ library Before Stylus, Groove Control¨ products were presented as standard CD-ROM sample libraries for professional hardware samplers like Roland, Akai and Gigastudio.

There are several keyboard-mouse combinations that provide access to RMX features.  Kit mode Stylus RMX is capable of operating as a classic drum machine-style sound module in Kit Mode. In the global Kit Mode, there are no loops. Instead, individual drum hits are presented in a General MIDI compatible way. More...  Kits When in Kit Mode, you can save the entire current state of RMX as a patch and give it a custom name. Then later you can reload the Kit patch or share it with someone else on another computer. A Kit is the same concept as a Multi patch, but it is specifically for use in the global Kit Mode. A large library of factory Kits are available in Kit mode. More...  Knob A control that can be turned clockwise and counterclockwise. A knob can be used to control a wide variety of parameters.  Learn MIDI Learn is capable of mating an external physical controller with virtually any parameter inside Stylus RMX for remote performance control and automation applications. More...

Usually they are presented vertically.  Loop Playing the same audio repeatedly using the same start and end points so that once the end point is reached, the audio begins again immediately from the start point. Often refers to drum patterns, but can apply to any source audio that is repeating in a cyclical manner. In RMX, we use the term &#147;Groove Element&#148; instead of Loop, because the groove element in SAGE is far more flexible than a standard audio loop.  Master Directory The top-most organizational directory in RMX that offers the broadest categories and areas to start choosing from. More...  Measure A group of beats consisting of a primary beat followed by one or more secondary beats. Bar lines usually denote the beginning and end of a measure. Synonymous with Bar.

Part Each RMX Part can load its own sounds and operate independently of all the other Parts. A Part can be a single Groove, a Groove Menu, a Sound Menu or a Kit Module. There are 8 Parts in RMX. Each one has its own numbered button in the Footer. Parts 1-8 correspond to MIDI Channels 1-8. More...  Pass One Pass has been completed when a groove has played from its start point to its end point.  Patch A pre-saved set of parameters. Also known as a Preset. A Factory Patch is a patch created by Spectrasonics. A User Patch is a patch that you can save and name yourself. The name comes from older synthesizer days when many physical patch cords were used to create sounds by connecting parts of the synthesizer together with the patch cords. More...  Peak Peak value is the maximum instantaneous excursion from zero of an audio waveform, as measured by a peak meter (PPM). The peak value of a sound is also the maximum instantaneous pressure excursion of the sound  Pitch Shift The process of changing the frequency of a sound. It can be changed so that it is higher or lower. More...  Plug-In A software application that relies on running from within a host application to provide additional needed functionality.  Pop-up Menu A list that seems to appear from nowhere. An example of this is the FX Patch pop-up menu. Cntrl-Click (Mac) or Right-Click (PC) anywhere on an FX Slot and a list appears out of thin air! Synonymous with drop-down menu.  Power Filter A great sounding filter developed in cooperation with Gmedia from their reknowned impOSCar synthesizer. Be careful when using it though, because the Power Filter can be VERY loud and it requires a fair amount of DSP power from your computer. More...  Preset A set of parameters that has been previously saved and is available for recall. Sysnonymous with Patch.  ReCycleª A software application developed by Propellerhead Software that allows slicing of audio files. Slicing an audio file with ReCycle results in a REX file which can be converted and imported into RMX using the SAGE Converter utility application included with Stylus RMX. More...  Retrigger When this parameter is activated, RMX resets an LFO waveform back to its beginning phase position at the start of each measure. More...  Reverse Plays a sample backwards. More...

REX files can be converted and imported into RMX using the SAGE Converter utility that comes with Stylus RMX. More...  RMS Compression Root Mean Square. A formula for describing the level of a signal. RMS is derived by squaring all of the instantaneous voltages along a waveform, averaging the squared values, and taking the square root of that number. For sine-like signals, average power = RMS(voltage) RMS(current)  RTAS Real Time Audio Suite - a Digidesign proprietary, cross-platform plug-in format for Pro Tools.  S.A.G.E. Spectrasonics Advanced Groove Engine - when Spectrasonics created our own in-house software development team, SAGE was the technology developed that became the basis for Stylus RMX. More...  SAGE Xpander These are Groove Controlª activated expansion audio groove libraries for SAGE powered instruments like Stylus RMX that can be purchased separately and installed inside RMX. They contain a great variety of new sounds and genres that are different from the core library, and are already in the SAGE format. Currently, there are nine SAGE Xpander titles available from Spectrasonics and ILIO Entertainments. More...  SAGE Converter A standalone software utility application that allows you to import ReCycle format audio files and convert Akai and Roland Groove Control CD-ROM libraries from Spectrasonics and ILIO. More...  Sample Start Parameter that controls, from a timing standpoint, how far from the beginning a sample will be triggered. When Reverse is engaged, this controls the end point. More...  Sequence A computer file saved by a sequencer/DAW that contains tracks of MIDI notes and audio files.  Sequencer A computer application that allows recording, entry and editing of MIDI notes and audio files. Also, known as a host if the sequencer is compatible with plug-ins.  Settings When switching from Element to Element, this button controls whether RMX resets all the parameters to their defaults or leaves them where they are. When it's on, it resets everything; when it's off it leaves the parameters where they are. This allows you to leave the current parameter settings intact while browsing new audio elements in the Browser. More...  Slice Menu A mode in RMX that places all the Slices of a single groove element across a keyboard (range of MIDI notes) More...  Slices When an audio file is cut into several pieces, each piece is called a slice.  Slider A control that you move back and forth or up and down depending on its orientation. Moving a slider can control a wide variety of parameters. Synonymous with Fader.

Sound Menus do not trigger when clicked from the interface like Groove elements. More...  Sound Directory A directory that contains Suites. It is the sub-directory of a Master directory More...  Standalone A software program that is capable of running on its own without a host application. More...  Sub-Page These are pages within a main Editing Page. For example, on the FX Page, there are 6 FX sub-pages.  Suites A directory that contains Elements. Suites are contained within Sound Directories. More...  Sync Abbreviation for Synchronization. When this feature is on, RMX locks corresponding parameters to the host's tempo and then adjustments can be made using rhythmic values like &frac14; notes, 1/8 notes and 1/16 notes. Otherwise the parameter is controlled by Cycles per second. More...  Time Signature The Time Signature of a piece of music is noted at the beginning in the form of two numbersÑone on top of the other. The bottom number indicates the unit of measurement (quarter note, eighth note, etc.) and the top number indicates the number of these units or beats in one measure. More...  Transport 1)    In RMX, these are the play and stop buttons 2)    In a host, these are the play, stop, fast forward, rewind and Record buttons. More...  Trigger The process of initiating playback of a sound or groove. In RMX, triggering a sound or groove is the command given to play it. There are various ways to do trigger, depending on the current mode settings and element types, such as: pressing a note on a MIDI keyboard, pressing the All Play button, pressing a Part Play button, mouse clicking the name of a Groove Element.  Tube An electronic device which consists of various types of electrodes (anode, cathode, etc.) and a heating element, all contained in a vacuum. Its simplest form, the diode, is used as a rectifier. The triode is functionally similar to a transistor. Tubes are called valves in the UK.  Unity When a parameter is set so that it does not make any changes to the passing signal.  Unity gain A device which neither attenuates nor amplifies a signal. Most signal processing devices have unity gain, which means that they neither amplify sound nor cause insertion loss, and therefore can be added into an audio system at various places without upsetting the overall gain of the system.  Unlearn Parameters that have been mated with a physical controller can be unattached via this feature of the MIDI Learn section. More...  Value Definitions &#149; 8x - this value stretches a cycle of a parameter such as an LFO across 8 bars. &#149; 1/8 - this value cycles a parameter such as an LFO every 1/8 note. &#149; 1/8D - this value cycles a parameter such as an LFO every dotted 1/8 note. &#149; 1/8T- this value cycles a parameter such as an LFO every triplet 1/8 note.

Please read these Frequently Asked Questions and the License Agreement carefully before agreeing to install the software.  Are there any legal limitations to how I can use Stylus RMX? The main limitation is that you are not allowed to use it to make a sample library or another kind of sample-based product. You are also restricted from giving away or posting online any loops or samples created using Stylus RMX. However, you are able to use Stylus RMX in all musical recording applications without paying any additional licenses.  Does Stylus RMX use copy protection? Yes. Once you've installed and opened the plug-in, you'll have to authorize it on our web site to gain full use of the instrument. It's fast and easy, and you'll get your Response code immediately. You don't have to use your music computer to do the web authorization. You may also run the instrument in a limited Demo mode for four days if you wish before authorizing.  What if I need more than one install for laptop use, if my hard drive crashes or if I get a new computer? Not a problem...our web site is available around the clock to handle these situations immediately. It's very easy to do it online and you'll always be able to get the authorizations that you need for your computers from Spectrasonics.  I'm very concerned about what would happen to my Spectrasonics instruments if the company were to go out of business...would I be still be able to authorize them? Absolutely! At Spectrasonics, we believe it is essential to guarantee to our users the ability to get lifetime authorizations for the Spectrasonics instruments they have purchased. In the unlikely event that the company were to go out of business, we would provide the ability for all registered users to get continued authorizations. In fact, there already exists a system in place for this contingency. However, the good news is that this event is highly unlikely... we plan to be around for many, many years!  Do I have to credit Spectrasonics if I use Stylus RMX on a project? No, it isn't mandatory for our instruments...but we certainly would appreciate it!  Do I need to obtain a special license to use Stylus RMX on a commercial project? No, the lifetime license fee to use the samples is covered in the purchase price of the instrument. You can use it on as many of your own projects as you like and we hope that you make some hits with it!  Can I use Stylus RMX on Music Libraries or Film Trailers? Yes, this is fine. Some soundware companies restrict this kind of use, but Spectrasonics doesn't.  Can I use Stylus RMX in multimedia or game music projects? Yes, this is OK unless you want to put isolated Stylus RMX loops or samples encoded into the game. That would require an additional license. Please contact us for more details if you wish to do this.  I work at a production music studio with several other composers/producers. Can we all use Stylus RMX from our main server? No. It's very important to know that each composer must have his or her own copy and license for Stylus RMX. We make regular checks to verify that large production studios have obtained the proper licenses for our instruments and sample libraries.  As a studio owner, can I include Stylus RMX on a rental or studio computer for studio clients to use on their projects? No....the standard license to use Stylus RMX is only granted to the buyer. We have a &quot;single user/multiple computer&quot; lifetime license policy. If it is a recording project that you are producing, of course that isn't a problem... but your studio clients aren't licensed to use it for their own projects, and Stylus RMX use can't be &quot;rented&quot;. Multiple license packages are available by contacting your Spectrasonics distributor. If you have questions regarding multi-license packages contact info@spectrasonics.net  Does this mean that I can't use Stylus RMX when working on someone else's project? No problem. The &quot;single user&quot; is defined as the person who is licensed to use the software instrument. This means that the licensed user can use it on an unlimited number of musical projects they are involved in. This can be a persons own project, a project where they are acting as a producer for another artist, as a session musician performing on someone else's project live or in the studio, etc, etc. The main point of our license agreement is the concept of a single licensed user. If a licensed Stylus RMX user is not musically involved in a project, that is where there is a restriction... hence the inability to simply rent the instrument or rent &quot;time&quot; to use the instrument as part of a studios services. Most of our customers use their Spectrasonics instruments on many different kinds of musical projects for different artists and collaborations.  I've never heard of these kinds of licensing restrictions before. This seems unusual and totally different from using hardware sound modules. Why does Spectrasonics have such an unusual policy? It's not actually unusual at all or even unique to Spectrasonics. In fact, this is the identical type of license agreement used by thousands of sample libraries, virtually all sample-based virtual instruments and the vast majority of music software. Single-user license agreements do have different restrictions compared to using hardware devices, and many people are not aware of these types of differences and restrictions. Part of the purpose of this FAQ section is to serve as a clear explanation of our policies. In this case, these types of &quot;single user&quot; license restrictions are standard for nearly all software/soundware companies, not only Spectrasonics.  Can my writing partner use a copy of my instrument on their computer? No....the license to use Stylus RMX is on a per-person (single user) basis. They would need their own copy of Stylus RMX to use it on their computer.  Can I install my Stylus RMX on a client's computer for their use? Not unless they are a licensed user. They will need their own serial number and registration to be licensed to use the instrument.  Can I resell Stylus RMX used to someone else? Not without obtaining a license transfer from Spectrasonics. The sounds and software are licensed and registered ONLY to you (single user). You cannot automatically transfer the license to someone else, and therefore you cannot simply sell it used. If you do attempt to sell it used without obtaining a license transfer, the buyer will not be able to use the product because it is registered and licensed to you. The Stylus RMX license is the right given to a single person to use the instrument. When you purchase the product, you are primarily purchasing the right to use the product. Also, if you sell your computer that has a Spectrasonics instrument installed on it, you are required to delete it first from the hard drive.  How would I obtain a license transfer and how much does it cost? Because circumstances can vary so much, we only grant license transfers on a case-by-case basis. When a license transfer is granted, there is a standard fee required which covers all the rights for future tech support, free software updates and the musical sound recording licensing use of both the previous and new user. (Please see our website or contact us directly to inquire about the current pricing).  Please note that purchasing an instrument new from an authorized Spectrasonics dealer is the only way to retain the complete rights for our special &ldquo;Upgrade&rdquo; offers. Although the used buyer does retain full access to all future free maintenance updates and tech support, license transferees do not retain the same rights for special upgrade offers.  If you have more questions about obtaining license transfers, you can contact us at info@spectrasonics.net  Can I use the demo songs? No, they are just there to give you an idea of what Stylus RMX can do. It's fine to use the library of Multi patches of course.  &nbsp;");sQ1[162]=new Array("legal/page01.html","LEGAL NOTICES - Software License Agreement","","LEGAL NOTICES - Software License Agreement  NOTICE TO USER: THIS IS A CONTRACT.

If you batch convert an entire REX library by using drag and drop in the SAGE Converter, a new library directory with corresponding Suites will automatically be created.  If you convert Suites of REX files, they are first placed in the Converted REX Files library directory.   RE-ORGANIZING USER LIBRARIES Since the list of Converted REX Suites can get very long over time, you can manually reorganize the suites directory on your drive.  Simply create your own library directories inside the SAGE/SAGE Libraries/User Libraries directory, and move the desired Suite directories into the newly created Library directories.   This helps keep all your imported sounds organized. In the picture below, the &#147;Converted REX Files&#148; directory does not even appear in the list of User Libraries.

A template patch consists of all the MIDI Learn settings in RMX.  You can use this feature to make a customized template for your own specific hardware controller, and also to take advantage of pre-made controller setups that Spectrasonics and end-users have created for some of the most popular hardware controllers.  Template patches allow you to freely and instantly change which hardware controller you are using, without disturbing the rest of the settings in RMX.  EXAMPLE: Switch between a Mixer-style controller setup for studio use and a Keyboard-style controller setup for live performance.  You can also use it to alter what RMX parameters your hardware is controlling, without having to reassign the knobs on the hardware.  EXAMPLE: Use the same MIDI sliders for different functions in each template patch.   Factory Templates You will find several Controller Templates and supporting files already installed for you.

Once this item is chosen, RMX waits to see what knob, slider or button is activated on the controller and what RMX parameter is selected with the mouse. Once the RMX parameter and MIDI controller have been moved, they are learned. This resulting Learn is directly proportional. This means that moving a controller knob or slider toward 0 moves the RMX parameter towards it's minimum setting and moving the MIDI controller to 127 moves the RMX parameter toward it's maximum.  NOTE: Only MIDI CC messages are currently supported for MIDI Learn.

LEARN CONTROL INVERTED This menu item results in an inversely proportional MIDI Learn. This means that moving a controller knob or slider toward 0 moves the RMX parameter towards it's maximum and moving the MIDI controller to 127 moves the RMX parameter toward it's minimum.  To use this option, please refer to the previous paragraph on Learn Control. The Learn process itself is the same for both of these options. This Inverted option is useful because you may want to assign two RMX parameters to the same controller knob, but you don't want both parameters opening and closing together. What you want is to turn one knob and have one RMX parameter opening and the other closing at the same time. By using Learn Control Inverted on one of the parameters and Learn Control on the other, you can accomplish this type of &#147;Cross-fader&#148; result, which is quite useful.

(Cutoff, Resonance, LFO rate, FX sends, etc)  &#149; MULTI PART STYLE Controlling multiple parts with your controllers assigned to the same parameter on each part. (Mixer level 1-8, Pan 1-8, Solo/Mute 1-8, Cutoff 1-8, Resonance 1-8, etc)  Since RMX's part/channel/CC assignment is so flexible ( see Key Concepts), it becomes very important to have tools that allow you to manage the behavior when the incoming MIDI channel of the controller is changed, so that you don't have to duplicate every single assignment for every part and channel. Cloning and Omni mode are very useful for these purposes.  VIDEO: Please watch the video tutorial &#147;Setting up a Hardware Controller&#148;. All the concepts described here will make a lot more sense when you watch them in action!   CLONE PART 1 CONTROLS This menu item copies all the non-omni mode MIDI Learn assignments from Part 1 and applies them to Parts 2-8. Basically, this is a huge time saver because it saves the effort of having to manually assign 7 more identical Parts if you want the same part assignments on every part. A warning dialog box appears to confirm that you wish to do this.   NOTE: Notice in the above picture that CC#4 is controlling two different RMX parameters at the same timeÑthe Power Filter Drive and Power Filter Width. You can assign several RMX parameters to a single external controller for dramatic changes with a single slider. This is true for buttons as well. For example, it is possible to assign 5 Part Play buttons to a single external controller button.   MAKE CONTROLS OMNI RMX is MIDI input channel sensitive when MIDI Learning. This means that it can distinguish between a button transmitting Ch 1 and the same button transmitting Ch 2. Selecting this menu item allows all non-cloned MIDI Learn settings to respond to any incoming MIDI channel (ie; MIDI Omni mode reception). This is very useful when you want RMX to respond to an external control regardless of the current incoming MIDI channel.  HINT: This OMNI function is ideal for the typical hardware controller system that gets &#147;channelized&#148; when changing RMX tracks in a host. Almost all systems that have a keyboard controller that has knobs/sliders with a sequencer host work this way.   NOTE: There is no &#147;UNDO&#148; for this feature.

These consisted of special CD-ROM sample libraries that were loaded into a hardware sampler and contained matching MIDI files that the user loaded into a MIDI sequencer for playback. Significantly, this was the first time that sliced audio methods had been presented in true stereo and with such high quality results. Although it was a somewhat cumbersome process to use by today's standards, Groove Control libraries changed how many professional users approached rhythm based audio material, since it allowed the loop to adapt to the music, instead of the other way around.  In 2002, Spectrasonics introduced the original Stylus Vinyl Groove Module, which was the world's first Groove Control activated Virtual Instrument plug-in. Stylus made using Groove Control much easier, since it eliminated the need for a separate sampler by integrating its massive core library with a custom playback engine and simple interface. Because of its ease of use, the original Stylus Vinyl Groove Module (aka &#147;Classic Stylus&#148;) was extremely popular and successfully introduced a whole new generation of musicians, composers, songwriters, producers and remixers to the musical advantages of Groove Control.  With the introduction of the Stylus RMX Realtime Groove Module, the major breakthrough is the innovative Spectrasonics Advanced Groove Engine (S.A.G.E.) -which integrates all the components of the Groove Control system into a powerful software engine that offers many new capabilities and advantages that standard sample playback engines cannot provide.  When combined with S.A.G.E. technology, Groove Control activated libraries now reach new levels of creativity, flexibility and ease of useÑall in real-time! Innovative new features like the Chaos Designerª, Edit Groups and the integrated FX Racks allow the user to customize grooves in ways that were previously thought to be impossible.  In Stylus RMX, Groove Control is always active. There are no longer traditional reference audio loops, as were provided in previous Groove Control products. Anytime you hear a groove playing in RMX, S.A.G.E. is playing the slices internally. As a result, RMX always plays grooves synchronized to the host's tempo because S.A.G.E. takes care of all the behind-the-scenes tasks to keep the grooves in sync with the host. Most importantly, this new technology frees the musician to be creative, instead of trying to keep track of technical details.   &nbsp;");sQ1[181]=new Array("concepts/grv_control/page02.html","GROOVE CONTROL¨ - MIDI Modes","","GROOVE CONTROL¨ - MIDI Modes  When working with Groove Control in RMX, there are two main MIDI modes that affect how RMX presents the grooves and MIDI files to the user.  Slice Menu MIDI Mode In Slice Menu mode, Stylus RMX presents each slice of a groove on its own MIDI note -exactly like how Groove Control has always been presented. Pressing a single note plays a single Slice. The corresponding MIDI file on the Browser Page is a chromatic set of MIDI notes that trigger each slice in the proper rhythm. This MIDI file can either be drag-and-dropped to the host (if the host supports this feature) or to the desktop for importing into the host. Slice Menu mode allows any type of pattern, feel or timing changes in the host, since all the slices are presented with a corresponding MIDI note.  Groove Menu MIDI Mode In Groove Menu mode, RMX presents a whole groove on each MIDI note instead of individual slices. Playing a single MIDI note plays an entire groove at the current host tempo. However, the groove is still Groove Control activated; S.A.G.E. simply handles the responsibility of triggering the timing of the slice playback internally.  Groove Menu MIDI mode is very useful if you would like to have dozens of grooves available on the keyboard at one time for performance layering or linear song construction. The corresponding MIDI files on the Browser Page in Groove Menu MIDI mode are simply long, single-note MIDI Files that are the exact duration of the groove.  NOTE: Keep in mind that Groove Menu MIDI mode does NOT allow the same degree of pattern, feel or timing changes in the host, since the corresponding MIDI files on the Browser Page are simply long, single-note MIDI Files. It's not possible to represent all the individual slices of a Groove Menu MIDI mode RMX part, since one MIDI channel doesn't not have enough notes to represent all the slices of every groove element of the suite simultaneously.

All of these techniques involve ways of interacting with features from your host application and features in Stylus RMX. Sometimes the majority of the work will be done in the host, and other times the majority is done using features in RMX. The more you know about your host's capabilities, the more you'll be able to use the features of Stylus RMX to their fullest potential.  LAYERING In Stylus RMX, the concept of layering grooves has been maximized and vastly improved over traditional samplers. RMX is eight Part multitimbral and each Part is capable of playing many grooves simultaneously using groove menu MIDI mode. The layering possibilities are literally endless when you consider the massive core library included with RMX, the sonic shaping potential of the Edit Page, all the FX, the Chaos Designer, the SAGE Xpanders and the fact that you can import your own audio files.  REFERENCE: Read the Mixer and Groove Menus chapters for more info.  USING THE CHAOS DESIGNER The unique Chaos Designer feature in RMX allows you to quickly change many aspects of a groove. You can randomize the pattern, timing, pitch, dynamics and more. Using Edit Groups, you can isolate slices for Chaos. This is where the power of S.A.G.E. technology really comes to life.  Once you have altered a groove with Chaos Designer, it is possible to capture many of these changes into a new MIDI file and then drag-and-drop this new file onto a host MIDI track for further editing and arranging.  REFERENCE: For more info, read the Chaos Designer and Edit Groups chapters.  VIDEO: To see Chaos Designer in action, check out all the Chaos tutorial videos.  EDITING MIDI FILES If you've used Groove Control products in the past, you'll already know how this basically works. Now, the MIDI files are available from within RMX on the Browser Page and you can Drag-and-drop them directly into your host (if your host supports this feature). If your host doesn't support drag and drop directly to tracks, then you can drag the MIDI files to the desktop and then Import the MIDI files into your host from there.  REFERENCE: Read the Browser chapter for more information.  While Stylus RMX has many new features that speed up working with GC files, the original method of host manipulation of the MIDI files still has many uses:  &#149; Modifying the Pattern - It's easy to customize the rhythm pattern of the original groove element by reassigning the MIDI notes of the MIDI file using your host's MIDI editor. This allows you to match the rhythm pattern to an existing musical piece or change it into a totally new pattern.  VIDEO: Watch the &#147;Pattern Variations &#148; video tutorial for a demo!  &#149; Changing the Feel - By using the MIDI quantize and swing features of your host, you can either tighten up a groove's rhythmic feel to be perfectly quantized or completely change it to a different feel by increasing the shuffle or swing amounts.  VIDEO: Watch the &#147;Changing the Feel&#148; video tutorial for a demo!  &#149; Groove Templates - You can match the feel of existing MIDI tracks or favorite feels by using your host's Groove Template feature to use the timings of other elements in your track as a MIDI quantizing template.  &#149; Sound Replacement - You can replace certain sounds in the groove with other sounds. If you don't want a particular sound like a snare, you can use your host's MIDI editing functions to find the snare slices and replace them with other slices from the groove like hi hats or a different snare sound on another MIDI channel.  VIDEO: Check out the &#147;Sound Replacement&#148; tutorial video for a demo!  &#149; Changing Time Signatures - Using your host's MIDI editing capabilities, you can move beats to alter the time signature of a groove to any desired new time signature.  VIDEO: Watch the &#147;Time Signatures&#148; video tutorial for a demo!  REFERENCE: Read the Time Signatures chapter.  &#149; Creating New Patterns from scratch - Using your MIDI controller with RMX in Slice Menu MIDI mode, you can sequence a brand new pattern of your own from scratch by simply playing the slices of an existing Groove Element. In this type of musical application, you are ignoring the MIDI file for a particular groove and performing/programming your own groove using the original groove's slices.

A REX file is something anyone can create from a standard audio file loop by using Propellerhead's ReCycleª application since it is an open format, while a Groove Control native SAGE file is a closed format and only something that Spectrasonics can create.  Stylus RMX supports the REX file format by allowing you to import REX files via the SAGE Converter application. This stand-alone utility makes the process of using REX files in RMX very convenient. However, REX files may not work as well at different tempos compared to the Groove Control files in the Core Library and Expansion libraries.  So what's missing from a REX File that a Groove Control file has? Here are some facts that will help explain the difference:  REX Files are inherently limited by three factors:  &#149; Limited Tool set The only application that can create a REX file is ReCycle, so the limitations of the tools available in ReCycle for manipulating the audio slices are also the limitations of what level of quality can be achieved in a REX file. ReCycle is an older application and no other plug-ins or audio editing applications can be utilized in the creation of REX files. For certain types of simpler percussive loop material, ReCycle has an adequate set of tools for a skilled user to potentially create a quality sliced audio file. For more complex mixes or tonal loops, ReCycle's tools are not adequately suited to produce a usable sliced audio file.  &#149; The experience level of the &#147;Slicer&#148; The skill level of the person who is doing the slicing work is another very important factor in achieving the best results from a REX file. While high quality audio slicing may not be an artform, it is certainly a skilled craft that takes a lot of patience to learn and is far more rare and difficult than most people realize. If the preparation of a REX file is rushed, not sliced properly or carefully tested, the results will likely be disappointing and nowhere near the desired end musical result.  &#149; No guaranteed review process REX is simply an audio file format, not any guarantee of musical results that Propellerheads checks, tests or reviews. Anyone can create a REX file and the end musical results can range from fantastic to terrible depending on the source material and the skill and experience of the person doing the slicing work in ReCycle. Unfortunately, many commercial REX libraries are poorly sliced, while others are sliced very well. REX files are a case of &#147;Garbage IN, Garbage OUT&#148;, so your mileage can vary a great deal.   Groove Control¨ is not limited in these three important factors:  &#149; Unlimited Tools With our proprietary Groove Control development method, we are able to use a huge variety of tools and any combination of commercial applications to achieve the best results for each type of source material. This allows us to try many things until the end result is exactly what we want with no artifacts and the best possible sound quality. Many different processing methods are used on the audio, along with a lot of &quot;hand-tweaking&quot; and some custom software. This ensures that every slice of every groove sounds great and can stand on its own. As a result, GC grooves can be played at a much wider range of tempos while still keeping the highest standard of audio quality. Even complex GC grooves with ambient elements sound great when undergoing dramatic speed changes.  &#149; Highly experienced &#147;Slicers&#148; Groove Control files can only be created by a special, highly-trained and experienced Groove Control audio development group at Spectrasonics that works together to continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible with sliced audio. The group spends a great deal of time sharing techniques to create the best quality results for every loop. Only Spectrasonics and ILIO Entertainments are currently authorized to produce Groove Control products.  &#149; Guaranteed review process When you see the Groove Control logo on a Spectrasonics or ILIO product, you can be sure that every groove has been carefully scrutinized with an official review process to make sure that it adheres to the highest standard of quality.

In the past, Groove Control files only triggered a single slice at a time. Now with SAGE technology, Groove Control files have the ability to be multi-tiered, playing several notes at once.  This &quot;multitrack-style&quot; method of playing the groove's individual component tracks back simultaneously in real-time allows an even wider tempo range than ever, and with more sonic complexity while still maintaining the highest audio quality. We call these types of grooves &quot;Multi-component Grooves&quot;.  Multi-component Grooves have a diiferent type of note-mapping in their MIDI file than you'll find with standard groove elements.  You will likely find these unique looking MIDI files in various grooves with complex mixes in the core library or SAGE Xpanders. Multi-component groove MIDI files often use the full range of 127 notes and slices! We only use this approach when it's necessary or when it provides a superior sonic result.  Here's an example of a Multi-component groove in the core library. Check out this representation of the MIDI file for 174-World Hunt Combo:   The lowest line of notes are the big hits, the middle set of notes that repeat are the small percussion, and the high tier of notes are the snares.

Why is this happening? 99% of the time, this is because the audio driver that has been selected in your sequencer is not suitable for use with RMX. If possible, please use an ASIO Full Duplex driver. If this option is not available, you will need to try different settings with the available driver selections in order to find a good working combination between RMX, your sequencer, and your audio interface. Please consult the reference guides for the sequencer and audio interface for instructions on setting up audio drivers in your host. Im running out of memory, how should I have my Windows settings optimized for RMX?  On Windows, the paging file size must be at least 1.5Gb (it's best if this is set to let Windows manage it), or, if you have virtual memory turned off, you'll need at least 2Gb of RAM to use RMX fully with a lot of other plug-ins and applications that use RAM.  If you're getting &quot;Out of memory&quot; warnings with Stylus RMX, please note that we're always looking for ways to reduce the memory usage of RMX and we hope to reduce it further in future updates, but the bottom line is that it is a plug-in. That means RMX only has access to whatever memory is left over after your host and other plug-ins make their claims on memory. So, one way to avoid running out of memory with RMX is to provide it with more memory to begin with (by reducing those other usages of memory) or by increasing the total amount of memory.  On Windows, you can increase your memory capacity, regardless of how much RAM you have, by using the /3GB switch in your boot.ini file.  CAUTION: Some drivers are not compatible with the /3GB switch. For example, an old ATI driver doesn't work and the Digidesign M-box driver doesn't work. If there's a problem, you'll generally know right away because you're system won't boot. If that's the case, follow the instructions in the above link and boot without the /3GB switch.  NOTE: The &quot;Out of memory&quot; warning in Stylus RMX refers to virtual memory, not physical memory. This means that installing more than 2GB of RAM will not help eliminate this condition (although it often improves performance).  To add the /3GB switch as a separate boot option:  In My Computer | Properties | Advanced | Startup and Recovery, click Settings.  Click the Edit button under System Startup to edit the BOOT.INI file.  Find the current boot entry, which typically looks like this: &#8232;&#8232;multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\\WINDOWS=&quot;Microsoft Windows XP Professional&quot; /fastdetect  Copy this line and paste it at the end of the BOOT.INI file, and change it along these lines: &#8232;&#8232;multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\\WINDOWS=&quot;Microsoft Windows XP Professional 3GB Switch&quot; /fastdetect /3GB  This lets you choose between a conventional boot entry and the /3GB boot entry. If something goes wrong when you use /3GB, you can always boot back into the original configuration.  Save and close BOOT.INI.  Click OK to close the Startup and Recovery panel.  Click Settings again, and in the &quot;Default operating systems:&quot; dropdown, choose the newly created boot entry with the /3GB switch.   Click OK to close everything.

Loading Groove Elements, Sound Menus, And Kit Modules require memory. Keep in mind when working with Grooves Elements that Groove Menu MIDI Mode is FAR more demanding on memory than Slice Menu MIDI Mode. Groove Menu MIDI Mode loads all the Elements of a Suite into memory when the Suite is selected. Suites can have up to 64 grooves, so if using Groove Menu MIDI Mode across several Parts, memory usage can become very high. Slice Menu MIDI Mode only loads the selected groove element and the next one below it. Generally, Slice Menu Mode requires less memory.  Using FX Units, AUX Sends, the Power and Master Filter, Chaos Designer and playing lots of grooves simultaneously uses CPU power. REFERENCE: For more info, read the Power Conservation chapter.  How do I optimize cpu usage in Stylus RMX? Generally, the best advice is to turn off things you are not using. Choose &quot;Part Clear&quot; from the Utility Menu on parts you're not using. Remove effects you're not using from effects racks. Turn down all the aux send controls on the mixer page if you're not using aux effects. Deactivate unused edit groups. The Power Filter sounds great, but can use quite a bit of cpu, so use the tone filter instead and save the Power Filter for when you really need it.

The one-shot samples in the original Stylus sound menus are presented in RMX organized by sound type instead of by number. If you need to locate a particular sample for an older project, it may be easier and faster just to use the original Classic Stylus and render the track as audio.  But I still can't find the Classic Stylus reverse cymbals. Where are they? Take any of the Cymbal Sound Menus and press the Reverse button on the Edit Page. J VIDEO: For more ideas, watch the &#147;Reverse Cymbals Must Die!&#148; video tutorial.  Where are the Classic Stylus Groove Menus? They can be found in the &#147;Core Library&#148; Master Directory/&#148;Example Groove Menus&#148; Sound Directory. Use Groove Menu MIDI mode.  My old Classic Stylus songs don't work with RMX. What am I doing wrong? RMX and Classic Stylus are two completely independent plug-ins. RMX does not load in place of Classic when reloading an old session. If you need to reload old songs that used Classic, it is recommended that you keep Classic installed. We also recommend rendering/bouncing Classic Stylus tracks from older projects to audio tracks for archival purposes. That way you can be sure that those tracks will always load on future systems.  Classic Stylus had a cool Zone Edit mode. How can you do this type of editing in RMX? Zone Edit in Classic was a feature that allowed you to isolate each slice of a groove and treat each one with a unique set of parameters. You can do something very similar to Zone Edit by using the &#147;Create Edit Group (First play a MIDI note)&#148; feature in the Edit Group menu. There are 16 Edit Groups available per part. This allows for a high degree of flexibility when customizing grooves.  The downside to the old Zone Edit method in Classic Stylus was that it forced you to duplicate your editing efforts many times if you wanted the same parameters on certain slices. For example, let's say you wanted all the snare slices pitched down. In Classic, you would have to find all the snare slices manually and then pitch shift each one manually. In RMX, the Edit Groups feature takes this to the next level. Edit Groups allow you to isolate as many slices as you like into a single Edit Group and then treat them all the same. RMX will even Auto Assign slices for you. For instance, many snare slices generally fall on beats 2 and 4. There is an Auto Assign menu choice that finds all slices in the groove that fall on beats 2 and 4 and puts them into a single Edit Group. This speeds up slice selection and allows for quick adjustments. Also, slices can be added or removed from any Edit Group at any time.

You need to use Propellerhead's ReCycleª software application to create a REX file from your audio. Then, you can use the SAGE Converter application to import the REX file into RMX. Remember, all types of sound material can be imported this way. REFERENCE: For more info, read the Importing Audio chapter.  How can I import my own Kit Modules or make Sound Menus? Audio cannot be imported as Kit Modules and Sound Menus into RMX. However, there is a little trick to make your own single hit menus by making a &#147;fake&#148; groove element.  &#149; Place all your samples in a track and spread them out to make sure they don't overlap at all. &#149; Bounce all these sounds into a single audio file. &#149; Then create a REX file with a slice in front of each hit. &#149; Import using the SAGE Converter.  In Slice Menu Mode, each hit will appear on it's own key. This can be useful if you have a few samples that you'd like to import into RMX. REFERENCE: For more info, read the Importing Audio chapter.  How can I use standard audio sampling CDs? First, you need to import the sounds into your computer. Then, using Propellerhead's ReCycle, create REX files from your files. Finally, import these REX files into RMX using the SAGE Converter application. REFERENCE: For more info, read the SAGE Converter chapter.  How does RMX differ from a drum sampler? A drum sampler is generally designed for playing multisampled/multivelocity drum sounds and user imported one-shot AIFF/WAV samples for any style of manual drum programming. RMX is designed primarily as a &#147;groove module&#148; that plays a large core library of Groove Control¨ audio loops that trigger slices of audio in the correct rhythmÉas well as the ability to import new grooves/loops through. In addition, RMX also has Sound Menus and Kit mode for triggering single samples from the Core Library. REFERENCE: For more info, read the SAGE Technology chapter.  What other programs can create REX files? A REX file is a proprietary file format created by Propellerhead's ReCycle software application. ReCycle is the only program that can create REX files. REFERENCE: For more info, read the SAGE Converter chapter.  Is there any other way to get my audio files into RMX besides using ReCycle? No. The SAGE Converter application can only import and convert REX files at this time. REFERENCE: For more info, read the SAGE Converter chapter.  Why is the quality of REX Files sometimes not as good as the Core Library/Xpanders? Spectrasonics spends a lot of time and energy using many different proprietary sound design techniques to ensure that every slice of audio in a Groove Control¨ groove sounds great and will work at different tempos. Basically, the Groove Control¨ logo on a product is a guarantee of a certain level of quality. The Groove Control team has a review process that ensures that audio content has been maximized for sound quality and usability. All the grooves in the Core Library and SAGE Xpanders are Groove Control¨ activated. Currently, only Spectrasonics and ILIO are authorized to produce Groove Control¨ activated products. As far as REX files are concerned, anyone can purchase ReCycle and make REX files. While ReCycle is an excellent application, there's no guarantee that the results will be at the same level of quality of Groove Control products, due to the limitations of the ReCycle application and especially since the overall quality depends on the skill level of the person creating the REX file. REFERENCE: For more info, read the Groove Control¨ chapter.  Why do you limit audio import to ReCycle and not other platforms or standard audio files? The concept of REX files is the most similar to Groove Control¨, so it's a good fit with the SAGE Converter. Remember that you can always bounce something you like to an audio file and then create a REX file from it and then import it into RMX. REFERENCE: For more info, read the SAGE Converter chapter.  With a converted REX File, I'm getting a &quot;Use Components&quot; message in the Browser MIDI Drag and Drop area. What's going on? Your REX file probably has more than 128 slices, which means that a MIDI File cannot be generated - since that exceeds the maximum number of MIDI note events for a single channel. Check the original REX file to see if it has unnecessary slices or try breaking it down into multiple REX files before reconverting with the SAGE Converter.     &nbsp;");sQ1[199]=new Array("support/trouble/page09.html","TROUBLESHOOTING FAQs - Operational issues","","Troubleshooting FAQs - Operational issues  Why don't Sound Menu elements play when I click them? Sound Menus aren't grooves. They are filled with numerous one-shot samples that are designed to be played and sequenced from MIDI like a traditional sound module. REFERENCE: For more info, read the Sound Menus chapter.  Why doesn't RMX automatically just start and with my song when I hit play on my sequencer? Stylus RMX was not designed to start and stop automatically with the host's transport. The first reason is that you may not want RMX to start playing right at the first measure of a song. Also, you may not want all eight Parts of RMX playing all the time simultaneously.  However, it's possible to make RMX start and stop with the sequence on a global or per Part basis. (Please see the next question.)  What must I do to start the RMX playback every time I start the sequencer's playback and conversely, make RMX stop when the sequencer stops? The Play and Stop buttons can be automated in RMX in two different ways:  &#149; MIDI Learn: It is possible to automate the Play and Stop buttons of RMX to external physical MIDI controllers. You can press buttons on the controller and record the commands as MIDI. These commands can control Playback and Stopping of RMX on a global or per Part basis. Recorded MIDI commands are also easy to edit. REFERENCE: For more info, read the MIDI Learn chapter.  &#149; Automation: Enabling the host's automation feature allows you to place a Play or Stop command while the song is playing. You can do this at whatever point in the song you want RMX to Play simply by clicking the Play and Stop buttons on the RMX interface. If you want all the Parts to play, press the All Play button. If you only want a specific Part to play, press the corresponding Part Play button. To stop all Parts, Press the All Stop button at the point in the song you want RMX to stop. If you want only one Part to stop, press the Play button on that Part. All of these mouse clicks will be recorded as automation commands and RMX will play and stop at the appropriate times. Recorded automation commands are easy to edit. VIDEO: For more info, watch the tutorial video for your host.  How can I audition RMX elements in sync with an existing song? Do I have to drag &amp; drop MIDI files every time? It is not necessary to drag-and-drop a MIDI file just to audition a groove in sync with a song. If a song is playing, there are two ways to do it:  &#149; Click on the name of the desired groove in the Elements column in the Browser and the groove will start playing in sync with your song. Clicking the name again will stop it.  &#149; Press the Play buttons in the Footer and the grooves will start playing in sync with you song. REFERENCE: For more info, read the Footer and Browser chapters.  I hear a delay from the time I play a note until I hear a sound. Why? By default, the Stylus RMX Trigger Mode is set to &quot;Next Beat&quot;. This ensures that any grooves you play in Groove Menu mode will be in time with anything else that is playing in your song. If you'd prefer to trigger sounds immediately, set the Trigger Mode to &quot;Immediate&quot;. REFERENCE: For more info, read the Trigger Modes chapter.  Why doesn't RMX respond correctly when I change the time signature in the host? Most of the grooves in RMX are audio loops that are in 4/4 time. The grooves can be edited in your host to playback in other time signatures. REFERENCE: For more info, read the Time Signatures chapter.  What does the Settings button in the browser do? The Settings button determines if parameters are to be reset to default settings whenever you select an element in the browser. If it is on, the parameter settings will be reset whenever you make a selection. If it is off, the parameter settings will be retained. REFERENCE: For more info, read the Browser Settings button chapter.  How do I locate RMX's version number? Pop up the Utility Menu by clicking on the disk icon button in the lower right corner of the Footer. The version number will be displayed at the end of the menu. You can also &#8232;right click-&gt;Properties-&gt;Version (on Windows) or cmd-I (on Macintosh) on the plugin file to see the version number. REFERENCE: For more info, read the Utility Menu chapter.  Why do some Suites only have a single element and others have many? There is no rule regarding the minimum number of Elements in a Suite. Sometimes the method used in creating the groove didn't allow the possibility to include the individual audio components as separate elements, so only a single mix is provided. Often times, the musical complexity of a groove element dictated how many alternate versions would be presented.  Whenever I stop my sequencer, the Part 3 Mixer Level fader resets to zero. When is this bug going to be fixed? It isn't actually a bug in the plug-in, but an error with an older version of the default.mlt_rmx setup patch file which had a MIDI Learn error: Modulation Wheel was inadvertently assigned to the Mixer Level fader for Channel 3. This would result in this fader frequently being reset to zero by many sequencer applications which often send out a reset command for Mod Wheel.  &#149; A new Default Multi Updater is available to permanently fix this issue. The updater is located in the update folder. This special updater will replace this file with a corrected one in the SAGE/Stylus RMX/Patches/defaults directory. REFERENCE: For more info, read the Defaults chapter.  I can't see the name of a file that I made in RMX? What can I do to see it? Names of files used by RMX (parts, multis, etc.) are limited to 31 characters. So, if a file doesn't appear in RMX or can't be accessed or saved, check the file name length.  I'm not able to use Drag and Drop on the Macintosh. Go to &lt;user&gt;/Library/Application Support/Spectrasonics and get information on the Spectrasonics folder by highlighting the Spectrasonics folder, holding the Apple key and pressing I. Under Ownership and Permissions, please make sure that the Spectrasonics folder has Read and Write access.  Is there a way to drag all the MIDI files of a multi at once? No. Not all hosts are able to handle drag and drop of multitrack MIDI Files, so we did not implement this type of single MIDI file for an entire Multi.  How do I turn the RMX playback into an audio track? In most hosts, you can bounce, freeze or send the audio output of RMX to the input of an audio track in your host and record the audio from RMX. This is a great way to capture all the nuances of changes that you make to grooves in realtime. The resulting audio file is easy to edit in the host after the recording is complete. VIDEO: For more info, watch the tutorial video for your host.  Is it necessary to bounce tracks to audio? No. But the reasons that you may wish to do this are if you would like to free up the CPU and Memory used by RMX, edit the tracks you've created in RMX as audio, or to archive the song in a universal way that will allow other collaborators to mix it, etc. VIDEO: For more info, watch the video tutorial for your host.  Problems when using extremely large audio buffer size: If you are hearing distorted audio when you have your audio buffer size set to a very large value, try reducing it to 4096 or fewer samples.  Why doesn't RMX sustain loops with my sustain pedal? RMX keeps the MIDI sustain pedal (CC#64) free for user MIDI Learn assignments. REFERENCE: For more info, read the MIDI Learn chapter.  How do you replace a particular sound in a groove with a different sound? There is no automatic slice/sound replacer in RMX. However, it's not difficult to do. There are different ways to approach this situation. (In this example, let's say we want to replace a kick drum):  First way.... &#149; On the groove that has the offending kick drum, create an Edit Group that contains all the Kick Drum slices and Mute that Edit Group, so that the kicks don't play anymore.  Then you can go to another Part, load a Sound Menu with Kick Drums and play or program the kick yourself where it's supposed to go. Once you've got the timing of the groove, you could switch Kick Drum Sound Menus or play different MIDI notes within a Sound Menu to hear different kicks.  Second way.... &#149; Drag-and-Drop the MIDI file of the groove onto your sequencer track. Find the Kick Slices. Move them to another track and use them as the timing template for the kick drum track (make sure you put them all on the same MIDI note).  Now, you could load a Sound Menu on another part as described above OR: you could load a second RMX instance and put it into Kit Mode. Then you could trigger that second RMX with the Kick Slices you moved. Kit mode is setup to respond to the General MIDI spec, so the Kick Drum sounds appear on notes B0 and C1 (assuming C3 as middle-C). The cool thing about Kit mode is you can load up all 8 Parts with Kick Drums and all the Kick Drum sounds from all 8 parts will appear on notes B0 and C1, so you can make huge, fat sounding 8 Layer drums while still only playing one MIDI note. Also remember that you can easily add custom FX to each drum sound. VIDEO: Watch the &#147;Sound Replacement &#148; video tutorial for a demo!  What's the difference between Parts and Patches? A Part is a single channel of RMX. There are eight Parts in RMXÑeach one functions exactly the same as the others.  It is possible to save all the parameters of RMX as a Patch, so that they can be recalled later. Patches are useful when you want to save the current state of the Instrument. Loading a previously saved Patch overwrites all previous settings. REFERENCE: For more info, read the Utility Menu chapter.  How can I create my own patterns or modify the ones that come in the core library? There are several ways to do this:  &#149; In Slice Menu Mode, the individual slices of any Groove Element can be used as a Sound Menu. This allows you to create your own rhythm patterns using the individual Slices of a Groove Element.  &#149; Edit the MIDI file of an existing groove to create a new rhythm pattern. Drag-and-drop the MIDI file onto a MIDI track in the sequencer and then move the individual MIDI notes around to create a different feel. You can also use the Quantize feature of the host to change the &#147;feel&#148; of the groove.  &#149; Kit Mode is a global mode that turns RMX into a General MIDI compatible drum sound module. Kit Mode offers thousands of individual drum hits that can be loaded quickly into a General MIDI compatible kit.  &#149; The Chaos Designer's main purpose is to modify grooves. There are many tools at your disposal dedicated to altering the sound and pattern of grooves. REFERENCE: For more info, read the Groove Control¨ chapter.  How can I change the order of the FX in the Rack slots? Changing the order of FX is easy and can be done a couple of ways:  &#149; You can Copy FX Patches and Paste them into different FX Slots.  &#149; You can Save FX Patches and reload them into different FX Slots.

Watch the latest Logic and RMX video tutorial, which has a step by step demo of how to do it.  Why don't I hear output on aux channels when using multiple outputs in Logic 7? There is a minor problem with multiple outputs in Logic 7. On some occasions you may hear no audio on Logic's aux channels when routing to those channels using the B-H outputs in Stylus RMX. If you experience this, press the Play button in Logic's transport window until you hear output on the aux channels. You should only need to do this once within your Logic session: after that, the aux channels should work properly. Apple is aware of the problem and it will be fixed in a future Logic update.  When will RMX support Multiple outputs in Logic 6? This works currently! You can select the Multichannel version of the plug-in, instead of the stereo version. It is only versions of Logic newer than 6.4.1 that are affected by the change in the AU output implementation.  When will RMX support Multitimbral operation in Logic?

REFERENCE: Be sure to read the Groove Control¨ chapter for more techniques and ideas about using Groove Control/Slice Menu editing methods.   SLICES AND GROOVE CONTROL¨ All of the Groove Elements within Stylus RMX appear to the software plug-in as sliced audio files.   The timing information stored in the sliced audio file determines how the slices are triggered upon playback by the SAGE engine - according to the current tempo in your host application. Since there is no real-time DSP time-stretching applied to groove elements during playback, and the proprietary Groove Control¨ sound development method we employ produces extremely musical results with no artifacts, Stylus RMX is able play grooves back at a remarkably wide range of tempos, without sacrificing sound quality or changing the pitch.  NOTE: Sound quality results will vary significantly with imported audio and REX libraries, since they were not created using the proprietary Groove Control¨ system that Spectrasonics uses. Core Library and official SAGE Xpandersª will always produce the most consistent and highest quality results.  NOTE: A major advantage of RMX compared to Classic Stylus - or using traditional samplers with Groove Control libraries - is that no matter what MIDI mode is selected, Groove Control¨ quality is always active!   TRIGGER MODES IN SLICE MENU MODE In Slice Menu mode, Stylus RMX always responds immediately to MIDI Notes, regardless of the Trigger Mode setting. Using the different Trigger Mode options affects only how grooves are auditioned when using the RMX Play buttons or mouse selection of Groove elements in the Browser.  MIDI FILES In Slice Menu mode, a MIDI file is available to drag from the Browser page to the corresponding track in your host. In the MIDI file sequence, there is a MIDI note which corresponds to correctly trigger each audio slice of the groove.  If your host has the ability to display the MIDI file's name once it's been Drag-and-Dropped onto a MIDI track, you'll notice that the name of the file exactly matches the name of the Groove Element. Seeing a chromatic set of MIDI notes and the exact name of the file indicates that a Groove was Drag-and-Dropped in Slice Menu mode.  SLICE MAPPING In Slice Menu mode, RMX plays a single slice of a groove when a single MIDI note is triggered. All the Slices of the Groove are usually played back chromatically starting at MIDI note 36/C1.  A Slice Menu MIDI file is essentially the same type of MIDI file as a Groove Control¨ MIDI File.  However, this type of &#147;Sliced audio-style&#148; MIDI File is quite different than a &#147;GM-style&#148; MIDI file, that would have traditional drum kit programming and mapping. The sliced audio MIDI file will only correspond to its original Groove Element. Using this MIDI file to trigger other Elements or Kits will not produce predictable results or be compatible with GM MIDI drum tracks.  Typically, a piano-roll/matrix style MIDI editor view would look something like this:     EDIT GROUPS Creating Edit Groups in Slice Menu mode results in Edit Groups that can contain:  &#149; Slices of a predetermined rhythmic value using the Auto-Assign feature  &#149; Any combination of Slices from a single groove element by creating a custom Edit Group  &#149; Any combination of Slices from multiple groove elements in the same Suite, by creating a custom Edit Group   Edit Groups give you incredibly powerful control over the sonic character of Grooves.  REFERENCE: Please see the Edit Groups chapter for more info.   MEMORY USAGE In Slice Menu mode, only the selected Groove Element and the one below it in the Element column of the Browser are loaded into RAM. Slice Menu mode is much less demanding on RAM than Groove Menu mode. This is one of the reasons we chose to use Slice Menu mode as the default setting.  REFERENCE: Please see the Groove Control¨ chapter from more info about sliced audio musical techniques and working methods.");sQ1[209]=new Array("part_modes/midi_modes/page02.html","MIDI MODES - Groove Menu Mode","","MIDI MODES - Groove Menu Mode  In Groove Menu MIDI mode, all the Groove Elements in a Suite are mapped as MIDI notes across the keyboard -each key triggering a different groove in the Suite. This MIDI mode allows you to perform or arrange with dozens of entire grooves spread across a single MIDI keyboard - using each note on the keyboard to play a different groove. This allows you two major advantages:  &#149; Groove Menu mode makes it very easy to layer and mix grooves together in an intuitive and real-time way with a hardware controller such as a MIDI keyboard. Since the tempo is always synchronized, it's fun and easy to remix or add grooves to an existing piece of music. Combined with the trigger mode options, Groove Menu mode can be a very powerful mode for live performance as well.  &#149; Groove Menu mode is also very useful for arranging a single linear track on one RMX part of related groove variations that are intended for different parts of a song (verse, chorus, bridge, fills, fill bars, etc). This is especially true with the live SAGE Xpanders like Backbeat, Retro Funk, etc.  REFERENCE: See the Groove Menus chapter for more background on the history and musical application of Groove Menus!  VIDEO: One of the key tutorials is the MIDI Modes videoÉbe sure to check it out!  HINT: Check out the really cool Example Groove Menus sound directory in the Core Library, while you're in Groove Menu MIDI mode. It's full of interesting examples of how to use Groove Menus that will make a lot of sense to you once you try them!  GROOVE PLAYBACK/NOTE ASSIGNMENT In Groove Menu Mode, RMX plays complete Groove elements when triggering single MIDI notes. Each Groove Element in a Suite is assigned it's own MIDI note in chromatic/alphabetical order.  HINT: This means EVERY suite can be a Groove Menu!  If there are less than 24 grooves in a Suite, they will be mapped in Groove Menu mode beginning in order from middle C (MIDI note#60).  If there are more than 24 grooves in a Suite, they will be mapped in Groove Menu mode beginning in order from low C (MIDI note#36).    In the example above, 85-BeLow is the current Suite on the selected part.  There are nine Groove Elements in this Suite. The top Element, 85-BeLow Combo a is mapped to Middle-C4 (Note#60). 85-BeLow Combo b is mapped to C#4/61 and so forth until the last Element, 85-BeLow Vinyl GTR which is mapped to G#4/68.  If the Suite was larger than 24 elements, RMX would start the first Groove on low C (Note#36).  SYNC Using the different Trigger Modes affects how Grooves are performed both when playing Grooves from MIDI and when playing parts from the mouse or RMX play buttons.  REFERENCE: See the Trigger Modes chapter for more info!  MIDI FILES Drag-and-Drop MIDI Files found on the Browser Page are single MIDI notes in Groove Menu mode. The note is exactly the length of the entire Groove and corresponds to the Groove's assigned MIDI note in that Suite.  If your host displays the MIDI file's name once it's been Drag-and-Dropped onto a MIDI track, the word &#147;MENU&#148; appears at the beginning of the name. This indicates that the MIDI file was Drag-and-Dropped while in Groove Menu mode.  FAVORITES The Favorites system is extremely useful for creating custom Groove Menus, allowing you to arrange different grooves from many different Suites for live-playing on a single RMX Part.  REFERENCE: See the Browser - Favorites chapter for more info!  EDIT GROUPS Creating a custom Edit Group in Groove Menu mode results in an Edit Group that contains an Entire Groove Element, not just a single slice. The Edit Group is automatically named with the Groove element name. All Groove Elements in a suite can be automatically assigned to unique Edit Groups with a special command in the Edit Groups menu. You can also now quickly create/add/remove entire grooves from Edit Groups, simply by touching the key on your MIDI keyboard.  REFERENCE: Find out more in the Edit Groups chapter.  MEMORY USAGE In Groove Menu mode, selecting a Suite pre-loads all the Elements of the Suite into RAM memory. RAM usage can become high if several Parts are in Groove Menu mode and the Suites are large.   &nbsp;");sQ1[210]=new Array("part_modes/midi_modes/page03.html","MIDI MODES - Sound Menu Mode","","MIDI MODES - Sound Menu Mode   Sound Menu Mode is a special MIDI Mode for use solely with Sound Menu Elements.  RMX automatically switches to Sound Menu Mode when the Sound Menu Sound Directory is loaded. It is the only choice available. Sound Menu Mode always plays notes immediately when triggered and operates in the same way that you would expect a normal sound module or sampler to playback.

These Mode options are different than the ones available in Multi Mode. This allows for maximum flexibility when working with incoming MIDI. They are:  KIT CHANNEL 1-8 Each Part responds to a different MIDI Channel.  &#149; Part 1 = MIDI channel 1 &#149; Part 2 = MIDI channel 2 &#149; Part 3 = MIDI channel 3 &#149; Part 4 = MIDI channel 4 &#149; Part 5 = MIDI channel 5 &#149; Part 6 = MIDI channel 6 &#149; Part 7 = MIDI channel 7 &#149; Part 8 = MIDI channel 8   KIT CHANNEL 1 All 8 Parts respond to incoming MIDI Channel 1.  KIT CHANNEL 10 All 8 Parts respond to incoming MIDI CH10. This accommodates General MIDI sequences that default to transmitting percussion on CH10.  NOTE: There are no Trigger Mode options in Kit Mode because RMX always responds immediately to any note commands.  REFERENCE: See the Kit Mode chapter for more info!  &nbsp;");sQ1[212]=new Array("part_modes/trigger_modes/page01.html","TRIGGER MODES - The Modes","","TRIGGER MODES - The Modes  There are four Trigger Modes: IMMEDIATE, NEXT 16TH, NEXT BEAT, NEXT BAR.  IMMEDIATE As soon as a note/play command is received, RMX plays the Groove. There is no delay. Immediate Trigger Mode works well when playing notes from sequencer tracks or for instantaneous triggering from a MIDI controller. RMX starts the Grooves exactly as they are placed on the MIDI tracks. Playing Grooves in this mode does not provide any assistance in beat synchronization.  NEXT 16th This Trigger Mode waits until the next sixteenth note to play whatever note/play command was sent. In other words, there will be a lag time between when RMX receives a note command and when it actually plays it. This delay is a maximum of a 16th note at the current tempo. This makes it easy to synchronize multiple grooves by playing the note or pressing play just before the desired beat. 16th mode allows odd offsets for interesting syncopated results when performing live.  NEXT BEAT This Trigger Mode waits until the next beat to play whatever note/play command was sent. The delay is a maximum of one beat. Next Beat mode also makes it very simple to synchronize multiple grooves by playing a note or pressing Play before the next Beat.  NEXT BAR This Trigger Mode waits until the next bar to play whatever note/play command was sent. This delay is a maximum of one bar. Next Bar mode is the perfect mode if you simply want to synchronize Grooves on downbeat of a measure. You can press a note anytime in the previous Bar and it will wait until the next bar to play.   &nbsp;");sQ1[213]=new Array("part_modes/trigger_modes/page02.html","TRIGGER MODES - Internal/External Timing","","TRIGGER MODES - Internal/External Timing  The Trigger Mode feature works even if a host is not playing because RMX has it's own internally running bar/beat clock. RMX switches between it's own internal time system and the host's time system depending on the &#147;Play&#148; status of the host's transport.  &#149; While the host's transport is in Play, RMX's time system is disengaged and RMX follows the bars and beats of the host's playback.  &#149; When the host stops playback, RMX continues the hosts time system, but does so with it's own internal time system. Generally, this results in RMX continuing to play seamlessly.  &#149; Once the host transport Plays again, RMX allows the host to take over again. Starting Playback may not be in sync with RMX's internal time system, so there may be a slight hesitation in playback of Part Playing grooves while RMX resynchronizes with the host's time system.  RMX's internal time system is also useful for hosts that do not support delivering clock information to plug-ins.
