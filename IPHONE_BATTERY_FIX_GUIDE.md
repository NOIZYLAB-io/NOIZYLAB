## 1. Battery Health Assessment

### Check Battery Health
1. Open: `Settings` → `Battery` → `Battery Health & Charging`
2. Check **Maximum Capacity** (should be 80%+)
3. Check **Peak Performance Capability** status

### Understanding Battery Metrics
- **100-95%**: Excellent (new phone condition)
- **95-85%**: Good (normal after 1-2 years)
- **85-80%**: Fair (consider replacement soon)
- **Below 80%**: Replace (Apple's service threshold)

### Check Battery Usage
1. `Settings` → `Battery`
2. Review **Battery Usage by App** (last 24 hours / 10 days)
3. Identify apps consuming excessive power

---

## 2. Software Optimization (Do These First)

### Update iOS
```
Settings → General → Software Update
```
- Apple frequently releases battery optimization updates
- Always install latest iOS version for best battery performance

### Restart Your iPhone
```
# iPhone X and later:
Volume Up → Volume Down → Hold Side button

# iPhone SE, 8, 7, 6:
Hold Side + Volume Down (or Home button)
```
- Fixes most temporary software glitches
- Do this weekly for optimal performance

### Reset All Settings
```
Settings → General → Transfer or Reset iPhone → Reset → Reset All Settings
```
- **Does NOT erase data**
- Resets WiFi, Bluetooth, notifications, privacy settings
- Fixes many battery drain issues caused by corrupted settings

---

## 3. Display & Brightness Settings

### Optimize Display
```
Settings → Display & Brightness
```
- ✅ Enable **Auto-Brightness**
- ✅ Set **Auto-Lock** to 30 seconds or 1 minute
- ✅ Enable **Dark Mode** (OLED models save significant power)
- ⚠️ Reduce **Brightness** to 30-40% for indoor use

### Reduce Always-On Display (iPhone 14 Pro/15 Pro)
```
Settings → Display & Brightness → Always On Display
```
- ❌ Disable **Always On Display** (saves 10-15% battery)
- Or keep enabled but disable **Show Wallpaper** and **Show Notifications**

---

## 4. Disable Battery-Draining Features

### Location Services
```
Settings → Privacy & Security → Location Services
```

- Reduces battery aging by limiting charge to 80% until needed
- iPhone charges to 100% right before you typically unplug

### Limit Charge to 80% (iPhone 15+)
```
Settings → Battery → Battery Health & Charging → Charging Optimization
```
- Select **80% Limit** for maximum battery longevity
- Best for phones that stay plugged in often

---

## 6. App-Specific Fixes

### Facebook & Instagram
- Heaviest battery drainers
- ✅ Use Safari web versions instead of apps

- Disable push notifications for non-critical emails

---

## 7. Notification Management

### Reduce Notifications
```
Settings → Notifications
```

---

## 8. Connectivity Optimization

### WiFi & Bluetooth
```
Settings → WiFi / Bluetooth
```

- ✅ Forget unused WiFi networks (stops constant scanning)
- ❌ Disable **WiFi Assist** (`Settings → Cellular`)

### AirDrop
```
Settings → General → AirDrop
```
- Set to **Receiving Off** when not needed
- Constantly scanning for nearby devices drains battery

### Airplane Mode (Ultimate Battery Saver)

---

## 10. Charging Best Practices

### Optimal Charging Habits
- ✅ Keep battery between **20-80%** for longevity
- ✅ Avoid letting battery drop to 0% regularly
- ✅ Avoid keeping at 100% for extended periods
- ✅ Use **Apple-certified chargers** (MFi certified)
- ✅ Charge in **cool environments** (not hot cars)

### Fast Charging
- ✅ Use **20W USB-C** adapter or higher for fast charging
- iPhone 8+ supports fast charging (0-50% in ~30 minutes)
- Use Apple USB-C to Lightning cable or USB-C (iPhone 15+)

### Wireless Charging
- Slightly less efficient than wired (generates more heat)
- Ensure good alignment on charging pad
- Remove thick cases for better contact

### Overnight Charging
- ✅ **Safe** with Optimized Battery Charging enabled
- iPhone learns your schedule and charges to 80%, then 100% before wake time
- Use **Low Power Mode** + **Airplane Mode** for maximum overnight battery retention

## 11. Hardware Troubleshooting

### Clean Charging Port
1. Power off iPhone
2. Use **wooden toothpick** or **compressed air**
3. Gently remove lint and debris
4. **Never use metal objects** (can damage pins)

### Check for Physical Damage
- Swollen battery (screen separation, bulging back)
- Overheating during normal use
- **Immediately stop using** if battery is swollen

### Test with Different Charger
- Try multiple Apple-certified chargers and cables
- Third-party chargers may cause slow charging or battery drain

### Check for iOS Beta Software
```
Settings → General → VPN & Device Management
```
- Remove beta profiles if installed
- Beta software often has battery bugs

---

## 12. Factory Reset (Last Resort)

### Backup First
```
Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → iCloud Backup → Back Up Now
```
- Or use **iTunes/Finder** on computer

### Erase All Content and Settings
```
Settings → General → Transfer or Reset iPhone → Erase All Content and Settings
```
- Fixes deep software issues
- Restore from backup after setup

### Setup as New iPhone
- If battery still drains after restore, setup as **new** without restoring backup
- Tests if a corrupted backup is causing issues
