### ðŸ“ˆ CB_01 INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS
I have upgraded the metadata scanning capabilities, and the results are significant:

- **Files with Metadata:** 529 (Increased from 0 using strict BEXT).
- **Key Discovery:** 
    - Found `ACID 4` annotations in `EL-...aif` files (likely "Earth Loops" or similar).
    - Found rigorous `Artist: Sample Magic` tagging in `dth_...aif` files.
    
### ðŸ›  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
1. **Auto-Organize by Artist:** Move all files with `Artist: Sample Magic` to `_ORGANIZED/Sample_Magic`.
2. **Auto-Organize by Software:** Identify the `ACID 4` loops as a specific collection (likely older loops needing preservation).
3. **Rename/Normalize:** Use the `Title` metadata to rename cryptic filenames (e.g., `EL-A_82_01.aif` -> `EL-A 82 01 1.aif` - subtle difference, but one is the human title).

I am ready to proceed with **Auto-Organization** based on this new data. "Yes" to proceed.
