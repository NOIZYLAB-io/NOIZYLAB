## 🎯 The One-Liner

**NoizyLab** is building the "Shazam for counterfeit electronics"—point your phone at a circuit board and instantly know if it's real, tampered, or fake.

---

## 💰 The Opportunity

### Market Size
- **$75B** - Annual counterfeit semiconductor market
- **$50B** - Global electronics repair market
- **$2.1B** - PCB inspection equipment market (TAM)

### The Problem
Every year, counterfeit chips cause:
- **Aircraft groundings** (fake capacitors in Boeing 737s)
- **Medical device failures** (counterfeit ICs in pacemakers)  
- **Data center outages** (fake memory in servers)
- **Consumer fraud** (refurbished phones sold as new)

**Current solutions cost $500K+** and require PhD-level expertise.
