## Session Summary

### What We Accomplished Today

1. **Fixed noizylab.rsplowman.workers.dev**
   - Was returning HTTP 500 (binding errors)
   - Now running v3.0 with full health

2. **Created Master Code Location**
   - ~/NOIZYLAB/GABRIEL/ is now the home for all GABRIEL code
   - Consolidated from scattered locations across M2Ultra

3. **Upgraded Worker to v3.0**
   - 20+ endpoints
   - 10 AI models (llama, codellama, mistral, qwen, gemma, phi, sql, embed, image)
   - 5 AI agents (GABRIEL, SHIRL, POPS, ENGR_KEITH, DREAM)
   - Full repairs business API
   - KV storage API

4. **Set Up Shell Aliases**
   - `gabriel`, `gab`, `g` - navigate to GABRIEL home
   - `gorunfree`, `grf` - master command
   - `deploy` - quick worker deploy
   - `ask()` - AI question function
   - `code()` - AI code generation function

5. **Pushed to GitHub**
   - GABRIEL repo at NOIZYLAB-io/GABRIEL
   - Integrated with main NOIZYLAB ecosystem

6. **Moved Old Code to Archive**
   - Downloads folder code archived

7. **Created Memory System**
   - Daily logs saved by date
   - Ideas compiled in GABRIEL_IDEAS.md
   - Persistent memory across sessions
