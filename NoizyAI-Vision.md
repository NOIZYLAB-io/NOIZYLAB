# NOIZY.AI – VISION & CREED

> THE UNIVERSAL ARTIST-LED RIGHTS GRID.
> WHO DID WHAT. WHO GETS PAID. FOR REAL.

---

> **"I AM AN ARTIST FIRST. EVERYTHING I BUILD IS TO PROTECT OTHER ARTISTS."**
> – RSP / NOIZY.AI

**NOIZY.AI WAS STARTED BY AN ARTIST WHO REFUSES TO SEE OTHER ARTISTS ERASED OR EXPLOITED.**

---

## THE FOUNDER

**ROB PLOWMAN IS AN ARTIST. FIRST & FOREMOST.**

40+ years making music.
Commercial work for McDonald's, Microsoft, Deadwood, FUEL, and more.
Still creating. Still fighting. Still here.

**NOIZY.AI WAS BUILT BY AN ARTIST, FOR ARTISTS.**

Not by VCs who see music as "content."
Not by platforms who see artists as "creators."
Not by labels who see catalogs as "assets."

**BY SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE ERASED.**

> "I WANT FAIR & EQUITABLE TREATMENT FOR ALL MY FELLOW ARTISTS
> ALL OVER THE WORLD... AND ELSEWHERE!!"
> – RSP

## THE PROMISE

**FAIR & EQUITABLE TREATMENT. FOR ALL ARTISTS. EVERYWHERE.**

- Whether you're in Toronto or Tokyo.
- Whether you have 10 fans or 10 million.
- Whether you're signed or independent.
- Whether you're just starting or 40 years deep.

**YOU DESERVE THE SAME RESPECT.**
**YOU DESERVE THE SAME PROTECTION.**
**YOU DESERVE TO BE TREATED LIKE THE ARTIST YOU ARE.**

---

## THE PROBLEM

THE MUSIC INDUSTRY HAS A CREDITS CRISIS:

- PEOPLE GET ERASED FROM THEIR OWN WORK.
- SPLITS ARE VERBAL, FORGOTTEN, DISPUTED.
- MONEY FLOWS TO THE WRONG PLACES (OR NOWHERE).
- METADATA IS A MESS ACROSS EVERY PLATFORM.
- ARTISTS DIE AND THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS DISAPPEAR.

THE SYSTEM WAS BUILT FOR LABELS, NOT CREATORS.

---

## THE MISSION

**NOIZY.AI EXISTS TO:**

1. **REMEMBER** – Build a permanent record of who actually made the music.
2. **PROTECT** – Give artists ownership of their credits and splits.
3. **ROUTE** – Make it easier for money to flow to the right people.
4. **RESPECT** – Put creators first, always.

## THE TAGLINE

**"WHO DID WHAT. WHO GETS PAID. FOR REAL."**

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. ARTIST-LED
- ARTISTS OWN THEIR DATA.
- ARTISTS CONTROL THEIR CREDITS.
- ARTISTS DECIDE THEIR SPLITS.
- NO GATEKEEPERS. NO MIDDLEMEN TAKING CUTS.

### 2. TRUTH-FIRST
- IF YOU DID THE WORK, YOU GET THE CREDIT.
- IF SOMEONE DESERVES A SPLIT, THEY GET LISTED.
- NO HIDING. NO ERASURE. NO POLITICS.

### 3. MACHINE-READABLE
- CREDITS THAT COMPUTERS CAN UNDERSTAND.
- SPLITS THAT CAN FLOW AUTOMATICALLY.
- DATA THAT WORKS WITH FUTURE TOOLS, NOT AGAINST THEM.

### 4. OPEN & PORTABLE
- YOUR NOIZY.TAG GOES WITH YOU.
- NOT LOCKED TO ANY PLATFORM.
- WORKS WITH DISTRIBUTORS, PROs, LABELS, FUTURE SYSTEMS.

### 5. CALM & CLEAR
- NO JARGON. NO COMPLEXITY.
- SIMPLE ENOUGH FOR ANY ARTIST TO USE.
- POWERFUL ENOUGH TO HANDLE ANY CATALOG.

---

## THE SYSTEM (HIGH LEVEL)

### NOIZY.BRAIN
- THE CORE CREDITS GRAPH.
- STORES: ARTISTS, WORKS, ROLES, SPLITS, RELATIONSHIPS.

### NOIZY.TAG
- THE PORTABLE RIGHTS FILE.
- TRAVELS WITH YOUR AUDIO.
- MACHINE-READABLE. HUMAN-READABLE.

### NOIZY.RADAR (FUTURE)
- USAGE DETECTION.
- WHERE IS YOUR MUSIC BEING PLAYED?
- DSP LOGS, BROADCAST, UGC, LIVE.

### NOIZY.FLOW (FUTURE)
- MONEY ROUTING.
- WHEN USAGE = REVENUE, SPLITS TRIGGER PAYOUTS.
- DIRECT TO ARTIST.

---

## WHO THIS IS FOR

### PHASE 1 (NOW)
- INDEPENDENT ARTISTS WITH MESSY CATALOGS.
- PRODUCERS / ENGINEERS WHO NEED THEIR CREDITS ORGANIZED.
- SMALL LABELS WHO WANT FAIRNESS AND CLARITY.

### PHASE 2 (NEXT)
- LARGER CATALOGS.
- SYNC / LICENSING PROFESSIONALS.
- MUSIC SUPERVISORS WHO NEED CLEAN METADATA.

### PHASE 3 (FUTURE)
- ANYONE WHO MAKES MUSIC.
- ANYONE WHO DESERVES CREDIT.
- THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY, REBUILT FROM THE ARTIST UP.
