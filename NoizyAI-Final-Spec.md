## WHAT IT IS

**NOIZY.AI** – A creative system for musicians.

Three parts:
- **NOIZY.AI** – Remembers your work
- **LIFELUV** – Matches your energy
- **ENGR** – Makes things sound interesting

You own everything. No tricks.

---

## THE THREE PARTS

### NOIZY.AI – THE BRAIN
- Tracks songs, versions, ideas, sessions
- Knows your keys, tempos, habits
- Keeps everything organized so you don't lose work

### LIFELUV – THE TEMPO
- You set how hard you want to go
- System adjusts to match

| MODE | MEANING |
|------|---------|
| SOFT | Low energy. One thing. Be gentle. |
| STEADY | Normal day. Keep moving. |
| FOCUS | Lock in. Get it done. |
| CRUNCH | Short push. Then stop. |

### ENGR – THE SOUND
- Engineer, producer, co-writer in one
- Knows classic techniques and weird ones
- Three levels:

| LEVEL | WHAT IT DOES |
|-------|--------------|
| CLEAN | Polished. Correct. Professional. |
| EDGE | Character. Texture. Memorable. |
| CHAOS | Experimental. Broken. Then fixed. |
