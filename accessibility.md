# Accessibility Notes

- Voice workflows rely on Talon or macOS Voice Control.
- Keyboard-free paths should remain available for all flows.
- Keep color selections within high-contrast themes.
- Editor ergonomics:
  - Large font, high-contrast theme, block cursor.
  - Pin Explorer, Source Control, and integrated Terminal for quick access.
  - Use Bookmarks to hop between jump points instead of scrolling.
  - Error Lens surfaces inline issues; fix them in-place to avoid hunting through panels.
  - Prefer short, distinct voice phrases and suites for reliable activations.
