## ONE-LINER

## IDENTITY STATEMENT

**NOIZYLAB IS HOW I LET THOSE COLOURS OUT INTO SYSTEMS, SOUND, AND SECOND LIVES.**

---

## SUPER SHORT BIO (Social / Tight Spaces)

I fix today with ideas from tomorrow. NoizyLab: Calm Tech, Second-Life Sound, Future-Ready Flow.

---

## ALT SHORT BIO

Systems, sound, and second lives. All the vivid colours in my head, turned into calm, useful reality.

---

## MEDIUM BIO (About Pages / Intros)

I'm Rob (RSP). My head is full of colour: systems, sounds, and futures that don't quite exist yet.

NoizyLab is how I let that out into the world.

I fix computers and workflows so they become calm, boringly reliable tools instead of constant emergencies. I revive old music and recordings so they can finally be heard the way they were meant to be. I help people capture voices and stories before time takes them away.

A neck injury forced me to build systems that respect my body, my energy, and my limits. Now I build that kind of future-leaning calm for other people too.

If your tech, your audio, or your days feel noisier than they should, that's where my colours go to work.
