# CAROLYNNE COMPASS

> For Carolynne to feel safe, what needs to be true?

## THE THREE PILLARS

### 1. FINANCIAL STABILITY
- Steady income coming in (not feast/famine)
- Bills covered without stress
- Some buffer for emergencies

### 2. ROB'S HEALTH
- Rob is resting enough
- Rob is not destroying his neck/hands
- Rob is not running himself into the ground

### 3. PRESENCE & CONNECTION
- Quality time together (even small moments)
- Rob is mentally present, not always "working"
- She feels heard and valued

---

## WEEKLY COMPASS CHECK

Ask yourself:

1. **Is money flowing or at least moving?**
   - [ ] Yes / [ ] Needs attention

2. **Am I protecting my body?**
   - [ ] Yes / [ ] Pushed too hard

3. **Did Carolynne feel seen this week?**
   - [ ] Yes / [ ] Need to do better

## ONE SMALL THING THIS WEEK

> What's one tiny thing I can do for Carolynne?

- [ ] _______________________________

## "NO" SCRIPTS (TO PROTECT THIS)

### When someone wants random tech help:
> "Right now I'm focusing my energy on very specific work – I can't take this on properly without overloading myself. If that changes, I'll let you know."

### When a "cool project" pops up:
> "This is genuinely cool, but it's not aligned with what I'm building over the next few months. I need to stay locked in on that or I'll dilute my energy again."

### When you're too tired:
> "I'm at my limit today. I'd rather do this well later than badly right now."

## NORTH STAR

> Everything I build is so Rob & Carolynne can live comfortably, peacefully, and freely for the rest of their lives.
