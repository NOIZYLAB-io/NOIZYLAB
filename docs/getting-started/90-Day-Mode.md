# 90-DAY MODE: "THE NOIZY.AI ERA"

> Started: December 2024
> Ends: March 2025
> Filter: Does this move NOIZY.AI forward, bring in money, or make life easier for Rob & Carolynne?

---

## DECISION FILTER

Before ANY task, ask:

- ✅ Move NOIZY.AI forward?
- ✅ Bring in money (now or soon)?
- ✅ Make life easier for Rob + Carolynne?

**If NO to all three → PARK IT.**

---

## NOIZY.AI

1. Log 50+ tracks into NOIZY.BRAIN (start with FishMusic catalog)
2. Complete NOIZY.TAG spec v1.0 and generate first 10 tags
3. Land 2-3 paid NOIZY CREDIT CLEANUP clients
4. Build simple Artist Cockpit dashboard (even static HTML)
5. Document everything → future proof for scaling

---

## CASH

1. NOIZY CREDIT CLEANUP → first paying client this month
2. NoizyLab Calm Tech → 2-3 local repair clients
3. 2NDLIFE Audio Rescue → 1 paid session
4. Heritage Interview → 1 paid family session
5. Retainer / VIP Care Plan → pitch to best existing client

---

## HOME & HEALTH

1. Protect neck/hands → voice-first, automation, templates
2. Non-negotiable rest built into every day
3. Weekly reset with Carolynne (even 10 min)
4. One small thing for Carolynne each week
5. Sleep > hustle. Always.
