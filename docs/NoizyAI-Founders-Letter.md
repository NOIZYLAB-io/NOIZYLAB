# A LETTER FROM ROB

> TO EVERY ARTIST WHO FINDS THIS PLACE.

---

## I AM AN ARTIST. FIRST & FOREMOST.

Before I built anything.
Before I wrote a single line of code.
Before NOIZY.AI existed.

**I was making music.**

40+ years of it.

I know what it feels like to:
- Pour your soul into a song
- Watch credits get erased
- See money flow to everyone except the people who made the sound
- Wonder if anyone will ever hear what you made
- Keep creating anyway, because you can't stop

**I am one of you.**

---

## WHY I BUILT THIS

I didn't build NOIZY.AI to get rich off artists.

I built it because **I AM an artist** – and I'm tired of watching us get erased, forgotten, underpaid, and disrespected by systems that were never designed for us.

The music industry was built for labels, publishers, and platforms.
Not for the people who actually make the music.

**That ends here.**

---

## WHAT I BELIEVE

### EVERY ARTIST DESERVES:

**CREDIT**
- If you touched the record, your name belongs on it.
- Writers, producers, players, engineers, vocalists, remixers – everyone.
- No more "Various Artists" when there were real humans in that room.

**FAIR SPLITS**
- Agreed in advance. Written down. Honored.
- Not verbal promises that disappear when money shows up.
- Not "we'll figure it out later" that never gets figured out.

**TRANSPARENCY**
- Know where your music is being used.
- Know what money is flowing.
- Know who's getting paid and who's getting ghosted.

**RESPECT**
- Your time matters.
- Your work matters.
- Your nervous system matters.
- You are not a "content creator" – you are an **artist**.

**SUPPORT**
- Help when you need it.
- Tools that work for you, not against you.
- A system that has your back, 24/7.

## THE PROMISE

**NOIZY.AI IS ARTIST-LED.**

Not investor-led.
Not label-led.
Not platform-led.

**ARTIST-LED.**

Every decision we make asks:
> "Does this serve the artist?"

If the answer is no, we don't do it.

---

## FAIR & EQUITABLE TREATMENT

**FOR ALL ARTISTS.**
**ALL OVER THE WORLD.**
**AND ELSEWHERE.**

- Whether you're in Toronto or Tokyo.
- Whether you have 10 fans or 10 million.
- Whether you're signed or independent.
- Whether you're just starting or 40 years deep like me.

**You deserve the same respect.**
**You deserve the same protection.**
**You deserve to be treated like the artist you are.**

---

## THIS IS NOT A BUSINESS PITCH

I'm not trying to sell you something.

I'm trying to build the thing I wish existed when I was coming up.
The thing I still wish existed now.

A place where:
- Your ideas are safe
- Your credits are protected
- Your splits are honored
- Your money finds its way to you
- Your creative life is supported

**A place where you can just be an artist.**

---

## MY WORD TO YOU

I will never:
- Lie to you
- Hide things from you
- Take advantage of you
- Pretend to know things I don't
- Promise things I can't deliver

I will always:
- Tell you the truth
- Protect your work
- Fight for your fair share
- Build tools that actually help
- Remember that I am one of you

---

## THE CREED

> **EVERY ARTIST DESERVES TO BE REMEMBERED.**
>
> **EVERY CONTRIBUTOR DESERVES CREDIT.**
>
> **EVERY SPLIT SHOULD BE HONORED.**
>
> **EVERY DOLLAR SHOULD FIND ITS WAY HOME.**
>
> **THE SYSTEM WAS BROKEN. WE'RE FIXING IT.**
>
> **NOT FOR PROFIT. FOR ARTISTS.**
