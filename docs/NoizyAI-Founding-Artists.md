# NOIZY.AI – FOUNDING ARTIST PROGRAM

> THE PEOPLE WHO HELP BUILD THE GRID, GET PROTECTED BY IT FIRST.

---

## WHAT THIS IS

NOIZY.AI IS AN ARTIST-LED RIGHTS GRID.

THE FOUNDING ARTISTS ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE WHO:

- HAVE THEIR CATALOG LOGGED INTO NOIZY.BRAIN  
- GET CLEAN, FUTURE-PROOF CREDITS & SPLITS  
- HELP SHAPE HOW THIS SYSTEM RESPECTS CREATORS

---

## WHAT FOUNDING ARTISTS GET

1. **NOIZY CREDIT CLEANUP**
   - WE GO THROUGH YOUR CATALOG.
   - WE UNTANGLE WHO DID WHAT.
   - WE WRITE DOWN SPLITS IN A WAY A COMPUTER CAN UNDERSTAND.

2. **CREDIT PACK**
   - ONE CLEAN SPREAD OF ALL TRACKS, CREDITS, SPLITS.
   - PER-TRACK NOIZY.TAG FILES (OR EQUIVALENT FORMAT).
   - SIMPLE GUIDE: WHERE TO USE THESE (DISTRIBUTORS, PROs, LABELS, FUTURE TOOLS).

3. **FOUNDER STATUS**
   - YOUR CATALOG BECOMES PART OF NOIZY.AI'S EARLY DATASET.
   - YOU GET A SAY IN HOW THE SYSTEM EVOLVES.
   - YOU'RE FIRST IN LINE WHEN NEW TOOLS GO LIVE.

---

## WHO THIS IS FOR

- ARTISTS WITH MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF RELEASES.
- PRODUCERS / ENGINEERS WHO'VE TOUCHED A LOT OF RECORDS.
- SMALL LABELS WHO CARE ABOUT FAIRNESS AND ORGANIZATION.

---

## WHAT I NEED FROM YOU

- A BIT OF TIME:
  - A SHORT CALL TO MAP OUT YOUR CATALOG.
- YOUR MEMORY:
  - WHO ACTUALLY DID WHAT, EVEN IF IT'S MESSY.
- YOUR HONESTY:
  - IF SOMEONE DESERVES CREDIT, WE PUT THEM IN.

---

## WHAT THIS LEADS TO

**PHASE 1:**
- CLEAN CREDITS + SPLITS.

**PHASE 2:**
- YOUR CATALOG IS READY FOR WHATEVER NEW MONEY PIPES APPEAR.

**PHASE 3:**
- WHEN NOIZY.AI STARTS TAKING IN USAGE DATA AND ROUTING MONEY,
  YOUR WORK IS ALREADY WIRED UP.

## INVITE SCRIPT (FOR ME TO USE)

```
"HEY [NAME],

I'M BUILDING NOIZY.AI – A SYSTEM THAT REMEMBERS WHO ACTUALLY MADE THE MUSIC
AND MAKES IT EASIER TO GET PEOPLE CREDITED AND PAID.

I'D LIKE YOU TO BE A FOUNDING ARTIST. SHORT VERSION:
I UNTANGLE YOUR CREDITS AND SPLITS, PUT EVERYONE ON RECORD, AND HAND YOU
FILES YOU CAN REUSE ANYWHERE. IN RETURN, YOU HELP ME DESIGN THIS SO IT
ACTUALLY SERVES ARTISTS LIKE YOU.

IF YOU'RE EVEN CURIOUS, LET'S TALK."
```
