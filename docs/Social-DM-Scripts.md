# CALM TECH SCRIPTS

## PUBLIC REPLY (IG/FB)

When someone comments "CALM TECH":

```
Love this. 🙌
I'll DM you so we can look at your setup without you oversharing in public.
```

---

## DM SCRIPT – INITIAL

```
Hey [Name] 👋
You commented "CALM TECH," so let's figure out what your machine's doing to you.

Super quick questions:

1. Mac or PC?
2. Is this your main work/creative computer?
3. What's the ONE thing it does that stresses you out the most?

From there I'll tell you if it's a good fit for a NoizyLab Calm Tech Reset and what I'd do first.
```

## DM SCRIPT – FOLLOW-UP (After they answer)

```
Got it. That 100% sounds like a Calm Tech job.

What I usually do is:
– health + performance check
– deep clean + tuning
– safe updates
– backup sanity
– a simple report in human words

If you want to move ahead, I can:
– give you a ballpark price, and
– find a time that works for you (remote is totally fine).
```

## X/TWITTER SHORT REPLY

```
This 100% sounds like a Calm Tech case.
DM me:

– Main use
– Worst symptom
and I'll tell you what I'd do first.

# 2NDLIFE SCRIPTS

---

## PUBLIC REPLY (IG/FB)

When someone comments "2NDLIFE":

```
Ohhhh I love a good resurrection project. 🎛
I'll DM you so we can talk about your old tracks properly.
```

---

## DM SCRIPT – INITIAL

```
Hey [Name] 👋
You commented "2NDLIFE," which means you've definitely got some old tracks haunting a hard drive.

Quick questions so I don't waste your time:

1. Roughly how many songs / what kind of project? (single, EP, album, folder of chaos)
2. What era are we talking? (year-ish)
3. What bugs you most about the old mixes? (tone / loudness / balance / "something feels off")

Then I'll tell you whether I'd start with a Quick Resurrection (1–2 tracks)
or go straight to Catalog Revival.
```

---

## DM SCRIPT – FOLLOW-UP (After they answer)

```
That helps a ton.

Based on that, I'd recommend:
– [QUICK RESURRECTION / CATALOG REVIVAL], where I [brief 1–2 line summary].

If you're up for it, next step is simple:
– you send me [exported files / links / zipped session],
– I send you a clear quote + timeline,
– then we bring this thing into 2025 without losing its soul.
```

## X/TWITTER SHORT REPLY

```
I live for this.
DM:
– how many tracks
– what year-ish
– what bugs you most
and I'll point you toward Quick Resurrection vs full Catalog Revival.

# HERITAGE SCRIPTS

---

## PUBLIC REPLY (IG/FB)

When someone comments "HERITAGE":

```
That hits deep. 💛
I'll DM you so we can talk about who you're thinking of and how gentle we can make this.
```

---

## DM SCRIPT – INITIAL

```
Hey [Name] 💛
You commented "HERITAGE," so I know there's someone you're thinking of.

If you're okay sharing:

1. Who are you thinking of recording? (e.g. mom, grandparent, partner)
2. Are they local to you or somewhere else?
3. How's their health / energy these days? (just roughly)

From there I can suggest what a Heritage Session could look like for your situation.
```

---

## DM SCRIPT – FOLLOW-UP (After they answer)

```
Thank you for sharing that.

Here's what I'd suggest:
– One relaxed session where I guide the conversation
– A mix of questions + space for their own stories
– Clean audio delivered, and we can add a simple transcript too

We can do it [online / in-person if possible], and I'll keep the whole thing as low-stress as possible for them.

If that feels right, I can send you:
– a short outline of the session, and
– price + how we'd handle scheduling.
```

---

## X/TWITTER SHORT REPLY

```
That's a big one.
DM who you're thinking of + how they're doing,
and I'll sketch what a gentle Heritage session could look like.
```

# "NOT NOW" / "CAN'T AFFORD IT" RESPONSE

---

## GENERIC "NOT NOW" REPLY (All Doors)

```
Totally fair. Thanks for being straight with me.

I'd rather you come back when it feels right than feel pushed into it.

If you want something to hold onto in the meantime,
I can send you a short [Calm Tech / 2NDLIFE / Heritage] checklist
so if you do nothing else, you at least don't make it worse. 😉
```

---

## CALM TECH – NOT NOW

```
No pressure at all.

Quick thing you can do right now without me:
– Check your backups (are they actually running?)
– Clear your Downloads folder
– Restart once a week

If it gets worse, you know where I am.
```

---

## 2NDLIFE – NOT NOW

```
Totally get it.

One thing to do now: make sure those old project files are backed up somewhere safe.
Drives die. Don't let the music die with them.

When you're ready, I'll be here.
```

---

## HERITAGE – NOT NOW

```
I understand. This one's emotional and there's no rush.

If you want, I can send you a few simple questions you could ask them yourself,
even just on your phone, so you have *something* captured.

No pressure. Just don't wait too long. 💛
```
