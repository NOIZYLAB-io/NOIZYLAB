# Master Audio Engineering Lessons


## 1. Microphone Techniques
- Choose the right mic for the source (dynamic, condenser, ribbon).
- Placement matters: experiment with distance and angle.
- Use stereo techniques (XY, ORTF, spaced pair) for depth.
- Avoid phase issues by following the "3:1 rule" (distance between mics should be at least three times the distance from each mic to the source).

## 2. Signal Flow & Gain Staging
- Always check your input and output levels to avoid distortion.
- Use proper gain staging throughout the chain (mic preamp, interface, DAW).
- Keep levels healthy, not too hot or too low.

## 3. Mixing Fundamentals
- Start with a balanced static mix before adding effects.
- Use EQ to carve space for each instrument.
- Compression controls dynamics and adds punch.
- Pan instruments for width and separation.
- Reference your mix on multiple systems.

## 4. Troubleshooting & Problem Solving
- Listen for hum, buzz, or unwanted noise and trace the source.
- Check cables, connections, and power supplies.
- Use high-pass filters to clean up low-end rumble.

## 5. Studio Workflow & Organization
- Label tracks and organize sessions for clarity.
- Save versions and backups regularly.
- Document settings and signal chains for recall.

## 6. Legendary Engineer Tips
- "Get it right at the source" – Al Schmitt
- "Less is more" – Bruce Swedien
- "Trust your ears, not your eyes" – Sylvia Massy
- "If it sounds good, it is good" – Duke Ellington

## 7. Modern Techniques
- Use reference tracks and spectrum analyzers.
- Embrace digital tools but understand analog principles.
- Experiment with parallel processing and automation.

## 8. Continuing Education
- Read books, watch tutorials, and learn from peers.
- Attend workshops and masterclasses.
- Stay curious and keep experimenting.
