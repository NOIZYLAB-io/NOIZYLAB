# ARTIST-FIRST PLEDGE – NOIZY.AI

## THE CORE TRUTH

> **"I AM AN ARTIST FIRST. EVERYTHING I BUILD IS TO PROTECT OTHER ARTISTS."**
> – RSP / NOIZY.AI

## THE PLEDGE

**I AM AN ARTIST FIRST AND FOREMOST.**

NOIZY.AI EXISTS BECAUSE I WANT FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT
FOR MY FELLOW ARTISTS – HERE, ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND ELSEWHERE.

---

## WHAT THIS MEANS

### EVERY NAME MATTERS
IF YOU TOUCHED THE MUSIC, YOU DESERVE TO BE RECORDED.
NO MORE "VARIOUS ARTISTS" WHEN THERE WERE REAL HUMANS IN THAT ROOM.
NO MORE CREDITS THAT DISAPPEAR WHEN DEALS CHANGE.

### NO HIDDEN GAMES
NOIZY.AI WILL NOT PLAY WITH ARTISTS' MONEY OR DATA IN THE DARK.
EVERY FLOW IS TRANSPARENT.
EVERY SPLIT IS VISIBLE.
EVERY DECISION IS EXPLAINABLE.

### NO LOCK-IN
ARTISTS CAN TAKE THEIR CREDITS, SPLITS, AND HISTORY WITH THEM.
YOUR DATA IS YOUR DATA.
EXPORT BUTTONS EVERYWHERE.
WE DON'T HOLD YOUR WORK HOSTAGE.

### ARTISTS BEFORE INDUSTRY
ANY DEAL THAT HURTS ARTISTS DOES NOT HAPPEN HERE.
NO PARTNER GETS ACCESS IF THEY WON'T PLAY FAIR.
NO SECRET SKIMS. NO HIDDEN FEES. NO EXPLOITATION.

### RESPECT FOR THE CRAFT
MUSIC IS NOT "CONTENT."
IT'S WORK. TIME. LIFE. SOUL.
WE TREAT IT – AND THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE IT – WITH RESPECT.

### GORUNFREE
ARTISTS NEVER PAY JUST TO BE CREDITED PROPERLY.
EVER.

## WHY THIS EXISTS

I've been making music for 40+ years.

I've seen credits erased.
I've seen money disappear.
I've seen artists treated like they don't matter.

**I refuse to let that continue.**

NOIZY.AI is my answer.
Not a business pitch.
Not a tech startup.
**A safety net for artists.**

Built by someone who knows what it feels like to be on the other side.

---

## THE PROMISE

> **FAIR & EQUITABLE TREATMENT.**
> **FOR ALL ARTISTS.**
> **ALL OVER THE WORLD.**
> **AND ELSEWHERE.**

This is not marketing.
This is not a slogan.
This is a promise.

And I will keep it.

**I BUILD AS AN ARTIST, FOR ARTISTS.**
