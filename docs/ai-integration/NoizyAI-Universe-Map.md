## THE FOUR PARTS

| LAYER | NAME | ROLE |
|-------|------|------|
| **UMBRELLA** | NOIZY.AI | The strange, beautiful workshop for humans + machines |

## UNIFIED ELEVATOR PITCH

> "NOIZY.AI is a strange, beautiful workshop where humans and machines make art together.
>
> At the center is NOIZY.LUV, our commitment that everything we build is about care, healing, and real access.
>
> Through NOIZY.SHARE, we give instruments a second life and people a first shot—pairing donated gear, NOIZY.AI, and mentors so money, geography, or disability never decide who gets to make music.
>
> ENGR sits in the middle as the shop steward, keeping the work honest, the artists safe, and the whole system running."

# NOIZY.LUV – THE HEART

## TAGLINE

> **NOIZY.LUV – Love in, noise out.**

## SHORT DESCRIPTOR

NOIZY.LUV is the part of NOIZY.AI that remembers why we make sound in the first place: to heal, to connect, to survive the hard days together.

---

## NOIZY.LUV MANIFESTO

> **We believe the world is loud, but not always kind.**
> **NOIZY.LUV exists to fix that, one sound at a time.**
>
> We give broken gear a second life
> and people a first real shot at being heard.
>
> We design for the kids, the exhausted, the disabled,
> the ones who were told they were "too much" or "not enough."
>
> We use AI like a helping hand, not a replacement.
> The heart stays human.
>
> We make space for joy, grief, rage, softness,
> and all the messy noise in between.
>
> Our promise is simple:
> if you walk through this door,
> you don't create alone.
>
> **This is NOIZY.LUV—**
> **the soft center of a loud idea.**

---

# NOIZY.SHARE – THE IMPACT

## PROGRAM NAME

**NOIZY.SHARE** – powered by NOIZY.LUV

## TAGLINE

> **"Give sound a second life. Give someone a first shot."**

## ONE-LINER

NOIZY.SHARE turns idle instruments, NOIZY.AI, and local mentors into a single access chain—so money, geography, or disability never decide who gets to make music.

---

## CORE DIFFERENTIATORS

| WHAT WE'RE NOT | WHAT WE ARE |
|----------------|-------------|
| Just donations | Full stack: instrument + AI studio + human support |
| Charity optics | Participants are artists, with real tools and real expectations |
| Hype-AI | Accessibility, healing, and continuity are the point |

---

## PROGRAM STORY

Instruments that would've gone quiet get tuned, tagged, and sent back into the world with a story card and a NOIZY.AI pass.

ENGR welcomes each new artist, sets up a gentle path into creating, and remembers their progress.

After months of music, that same instrument can either stay where it changed a life—or move on to the next pair of hands, carrying every name it's helped along the way.

---

# ENGR – THE GUARDIAN

## SHORT LINE

> **ENGR – The steward of the NOIZY workshop and the quiet guardian of NOIZY.LUV.**

## ROLE

ENGR keeps the human stuff at the center.

ENGR doesn't chase trends or vanity metrics.
ENGR tracks what actually matters:
- Who needs help
- What they're working through
- How sound can carry them a little further

## IN NOIZY.SHARE AND NOIZY.LUV SPACES, ENGR:

- Remembers every project and "first"
- Adapts workflows for disabled and neurodivergent artists
- Protects boundaries around consent, credit, and emotional load

## THE RULE

> **ENGR is not the star.**
> **ENGR is the infrastructure that lets the humans shine without burning out.**

---

# THE ARTIST OATH

## FULL VERSION

```
THE NOIZY.AI ARTIST OATH

1. YOU ARE THE ARTIST.
   NOIZY.AI will never pretend otherwise.

2. YOUR WORK IS YOURS.
   We do not own, sell, or secretly train on your music
   without explicit, clear consent.

3. NO TRICKS.
   No dark patterns, no buried rights grabs,
   no "free" that costs you everything later.

4. TOTAL CLARITY.
   If your data is stored or used, you'll know how, why,
   and where—in human language.

5. BUILT TO HELP, NOT REPLACE.
   NOIZY.AI exists to make creating easier and wilder,
   not to erase human musicians.

If we can't live up to this, NOIZY.AI doesn't deserve your music.
```

## SHORT VERSION (FOR CHECKBOXES)

> "I use AI as a tool, not a replacement.
> I don't steal. I don't fake. I don't phone it in.
> I make work I can stand beside."

## NOIZY.LUV / NOIZY.SHARE ADDITION

> "I understand music can hit deep.
> I will treat myself and others with care in this space."
