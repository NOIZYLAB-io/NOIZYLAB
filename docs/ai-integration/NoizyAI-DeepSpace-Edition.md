## THE CREW

| ROLE | SYSTEM | FUNCTION |
|------|--------|----------|
| 🧠 | **NOIZY.AI** | NAV COMPUTER – Remembers every riff, lyric, version, mood. Plots safe routes from Idea Nebula → Finished Track Orbit. |
| ❤️ | **LIFELUV** | LIFE SUPPORT & AUTOPILOT – Reads your energy. Adjusts mission tempo so you don't burn out in hyperspace. |
| 🛠️ | **ENGR** | MAD SCIENTIST IN THE ENGINE ROOM – Knows every classic console, tape trick, and broken FX ritual. Warps sound until it's "wrong in exactly the right way." |
