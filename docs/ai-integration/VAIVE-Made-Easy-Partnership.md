# VAIVE MADE EASY – PARTNERSHIP PROPOSAL

> THE MUSICIAN'S FINANCIAL LIFE, HANDLED.
> POWERED BY NOIZY.AI + VAIVE & ASSOCIATES.

---

## THE CORE PITCH

> **"We're building an AI music system that does the OPPOSITE of ripping artists off.**
>
> **We want Vaive to be the trusted financial backbone that keeps it honest, fair, and transparent."**
>
> – RSP, NOIZY.AI

NOIZY.AI is built by an artist, for artists.
We need a financial partner who shares that ethic.
**Vaive & Associates is that partner.**

---

## THE OPPORTUNITY

**PROBLEM:**
- MUSICIANS ARE TERRIBLE AT BOOKKEEPING (NOT THEIR FAULT – THEY'RE BUSY MAKING MUSIC)
- INCOME IS SCATTERED: ROYALTIES, SYNC, GIGS, LESSONS, SESSIONS, MERCH
- EXPENSES ARE CHAOS: RECEIPTS IN POCKETS, BANK STATEMENTS IGNORED
- TAX TIME = PANIC, MISSED DEDUCTIONS, LATE FEES

**SOLUTION:**
- **NOIZY.AI** CAPTURES ALL THE DATA AUTOMATICALLY
- **VAIVE & ASSOCIATES** TURNS IT INTO PERFECT TAX FILINGS
- **MUSICIAN** JUST MAKES MUSIC AND CLICKS "SEND TO VAIVE"

---

## WHAT IS "VAIVE MADE EASY"?

A BRANDED INTEGRATION INSIDE THE NOIZY.AI ARTIST PORTAL THAT:

1. **AUTOMATICALLY CATEGORIZES** ALL MUSIC INCOME AND EXPENSES
2. **GENERATES TAX-READY REPORTS** WITH ONE CLICK
3. **SENDS DATA DIRECTLY** TO VAIVE & ASSOCIATES
4. **PROVIDES REAL-TIME TAX ESTIMATES** ("YOU OWE ~$X THIS QUARTER")
5. **SCHEDULES CONSULTATIONS** WITH GARY OR THE VAIVE TEAM

---

## WHY VAIVE & ASSOCIATES?

### YOU ALREADY KNOW MUSICIANS
- GARY LOWE UNDERSTANDS THE MUSIC INDUSTRY
- YOU'VE HANDLED ROB'S TAXES – YOU GET THE CHAOS
- YOU'RE ALREADY TRYING TO MODERNIZE (PODCAST ON SOUNDCLOUD!)

### THIS MAKES YOUR LIFE EASIER
- NO MORE CHASING CLIENTS FOR DOCUMENTS
- DATA ARRIVES CLEAN AND CATEGORIZED
- MORE CLIENTS, LESS ADMIN WORK
- HIGHER MARGINS PER CLIENT

### THIS MAKES YOU MONEY
- NEW REVENUE STREAM: MUSICIAN CLIENTS VIA NOIZY.AI
- REFERRAL FEES OR LICENSING DEAL
- "VAIVE MADE EASY" BRAND EXPOSURE TO THOUSANDS OF ARTISTS

---

## THE DEAL STRUCTURE (OPTIONS)

### OPTION A: REFERRAL MODEL
- NOIZY.AI REFERS ARTISTS TO VAIVE
- VAIVE PAYS $50–$100 PER NEW CLIENT
- OR: 10% OF FIRST-YEAR FEES

### OPTION B: LICENSING MODEL

## PITCH TO VAIVE (EMAIL/CALL SCRIPT)

### SUBJECT: PARTNERSHIP IDEA – VAIVE MADE EASY

```
Hey Gary / Rolland / Rob,

I'm building something called NOIZY.AI – an artist-led platform that 
helps musicians manage their credits, splits, income, and expenses 
all in one place.

One of the biggest pain points for musicians is tax time. They're 
terrible at bookkeeping (not their fault – they're busy making music), 
and accountants spend hours chasing them for documents.

I want to propose a partnership: "VAIVE MADE EASY"

Here's the idea:
- NOIZY.AI automatically categorizes all music income and expenses
- With one click, artists send a clean tax package to Vaive
- You get organized data instead of shoeboxes of receipts
- Artists get a seamless experience and real-time tax estimates

Benefits for Vaive:
- New client pipeline (musicians using NOIZY.AI)
- Less admin work per client (data arrives clean)
- Higher margins (less time chasing documents)
- "VAIVE MADE EASY" branding to thousands of artists

I'd love to discuss how we could structure this. Could be referral fees, 
licensing, or revenue share – whatever makes sense for you.

Would you be open to a short call to explore this?

– Rob
```
