## CORE BRAND STATEMENT

# NOIZY.AI MUSIC MAKER

## A Super-Sonic Co-Creator for Artists Who Refuse to Be Owned

**NOIZY.AI is not here to replace artists. It's here to give them a full crew in their pocket.**

It writes with you, drums with you, riff-checks your ideas, stacks your harmonies, and remembers your sparks at 3am—

**But it never claims your work, never buries tricks in the fine print, and never pretends to be the genius.**

> **YOU ARE THE ARTIST. NOIZY.AI IS THE GEAR.**

---

## WHAT NOIZY.AI DOES FOR AN ARTIST

Think of NOIZY.AI as your **portable, all-weather creative team**:

### 🎤 CO-WRITER / LYRICIST
- Hooks, verses, fixes, alternate lines, song structure help
- You decide what stays
- NOIZY just throws ideas on the table
- **YOUR WORDS. YOUR CALL.**

### 🥁 DRUM MACHINE & GROOVE BRAIN
- Beats that match your emotion, not generic AI loop wallpaper
- Human-feel variations, fills, and dynamics tied to your track
- **YOUR GROOVE. YOUR POCKET.**

### 🎸 GUITAR / ACCOMPANIMENT PARTNER
- Chord beds, riffs, textures, pads
- It supports the song; it doesn't try to be the star
- **PLAYS WITH YOU. NOT OVER YOU.**

### 🎶 BACKUP VOCALS & HARMONY ENGINE
- Harmonies, doubles, stacks, shouts
- Tuned around your tone and vibe, not some random preset
- **YOUR LEAD. ALWAYS.**

### 📓 SESSION MEMORY & PROJECT TRACKER
- Keeps takes, versions, keys, BPMs, moods, lyric fragments
- You never lose the "good version" again
- **YOUR MEMORY. INFINITE.**

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

> **One NOIZY.AI device = co-writer, band, and assistant that doesn't flake, doesn't judge, and doesn't take your rights.**

---

## LIFELUV – THE LIFE TEMPO DIAL

**LIFELUV is the flow engine under NOIZY.AI.**

You don't manage settings. You set your tempo, and it adapts around you.

### THE FLOW DIAL

| MODE | MEANING | HOW IT RESPONDS |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| 🕊️ **SOFT** | "Low energy, low bandwidth. Be gentle." | One or two important things. Short, kind prompts. Prioritizes mental health and recovery over hustle. |
| 🚶 **STEADY** | "Normal day. Keep it moving." | Clear, realistic plan. Light nudges to keep you from stalling, not nagging. |
| 🏃 **FOCUS** | "Let's lock in and get this done." | Structured blocks, focused suggestions, fewer distractions. Designed for deep work, not burnout. |
| 🚨 **CRUNCH** | "Short sprint, then stand down." | Intense support for a defined window (show, deadline, drop). Auto-cooldown after—because endless crunch is fake productivity. |

### WHAT LIFELUV CONTROLS

- How often NOIZY.AI taps you on the shoulder
- How much work it tries to put on your plate
- How hard it drives vs. how much it protects your energy

### THE RULE

> **You don't shove your life into a system.**
> **The system shapes itself around your life.**

---

## ARTIST-FIRST ETHICS – THE NON-NEGOTIABLES

**This is the anti-exploit AI.**

### 🧾 YOU OWN WHAT YOU MAKE. FULL STOP.
- Songs, stems, lyrics, arrangements, style: **YOURS**
- NOIZY.AI doesn't quietly convert your work into its "property"
- 100% ownership. No exceptions.

### ❌ NO SECRET TRAINING ON YOUR SOUL.
- No silent "thanks for the data, now we'll resell your sound"
- If your work ever trains a model, it's because **you chose it** and **you benefit**
- Default = private. Always.

### 🕳️ NO DARK PATTERNS. EVER.
- No hidden checkboxes, no sneaky license grabs
- No "by continuing you agree to let us own your catalog"
- Honest design. Honest business.

### 🪟 RADICAL TRANSPARENCY.
- Plain-language: what's stored, what's learned, what's never touched
- Clear logs of when your material is used and for what
- If you ask "why?" we can answer.

### 🧠 TOOL, NOT IDENTITY THIEF.
- NOIZY.AI can help you sound more like **you**
- It does **NOT** clone you for other people's projects behind your back
- Your style stays yours.

### THE STANDARD

> **If it would make a working musician feel sick to their stomach, NOIZY.AI doesn't do it.**

---
