## THE VISION

**NOIZY.AI IS NOT JUST A RIGHTS DATABASE.**
**IT'S WHERE ARTISTS LIVE.**

CREATE. ORGANIZE. PROTECT. GET PAID.
ALL IN ONE PLACE.

FROM THE FIRST MESSY IDEA TO THE FINAL ROYALTY CHECK.
NOIZY.AI IS THERE.

---

## WHAT ARTISTS CAN DO

1. **CAPTURE** – DEMOS, IDEAS, POEMS, VOICE NOTES, RIFFS, RANDOM LINES
2. **ORGANIZE** – PROJECTS, COLLABORATIONS, SONGS, TRACKS
3. **PROTECT** – CREDITS, SPLITS, RIGHTS, AGREEMENTS
4. **GET PAID** – USAGE TRACKING, EARNINGS, MONEY ROUTING
5. **GET HELP** – 24/7 AI SUPPORT FOR CREATIVE, RIGHTS, PLANNING

EVERYTHING FROM SPARK → SONG → RELEASE → RIGHTS → CASH
IS HELD IN ONE ENVIRONMENT.

## TAB 1: 🎙️ CAPTURE

> "ANYTHING THE ARTIST NEEDS TO BE... AN ARTIST!!"

### PURPOSE
GET IT OUT OF THEIR HEAD AND INTO NOIZY.AI.
NO PRESSURE. NO STRUCTURE NEEDED.
ORGANIZE LATER.

### THREE ACTIONS

#### 🎙️ QUICK IDEA (VOICE)
- ONE-TAP RECORD
- AUTO TIME + DATE
- AFTER STOP:
  - "NAME THIS?" (OPTIONAL)
  - "TAG IT?" (MELODY / LYRIC / RIFF / RANT)
  - "LINK TO SONG?" [LIST] OR "NEW SONG"

#### 📝 TEXT NOTE (LYRIC / POEM / TITLE)
- TYPED OR DICTATED
- TAGS: LYRIC / POEM / CONCEPT / TO-DO
- CAN BE LINKED LATER TO A SPECIFIC SONG

#### 📎 ATTACH / IMPORT
- DROP IN A FILE: AUDIO, DOC, PICTURE OF HANDWRITTEN LYRIC
- TAG + PROJECT + COLLABORATORS IF YOU WANT

### KEY RULE
**CAPTURE FIRST. LIGHT TAG SECOND. DEEP ORGANIZATION LATER.**

---

## TAB 2: 📚 CATALOG

> "MY WORK. MY PEOPLE. MY RIGHTS."

### PURPOSE
LIGHTWEIGHT VIEW OF NOIZY.BRAIN ON MOBILE.
HEAVY EDITING ON DESKTOP. FAST UPDATES ON MOBILE.

### WHAT THEY SEE
- VIEW SONGS / PROJECTS / ERAS
- FOR EACH TRACK:
  - TITLE
  - CONTRIBUTORS
  - BASIC SPLITS
  - STATUS (ROUGH / NEEDS CONFIRMATION / AGREED)

### WHAT THEY CAN DO ON MOBILE
- QUICKLY ADD A MISSING CONTRIBUTOR
  - "OH YEAH, JAMIE PLAYED BASS ON THAT."
- MARK A TRACK AS "NEEDS SPLIT TALK" OR "LOCKED"
- LINK CAPTURED IDEAS TO EXISTING TRACKS
  - "THIS VOICE MEMO BELONGS HERE"

---

## TAB 3: 💰 MONEY

> "WHERE AM I AT, RIGHT NOW?"

### PURPOSE
HIGH-LEVEL EARNINGS VIEW.
NOT ACCOUNTING SOFTWARE.
ONE BUTTON TO SEND DATA TO VAIVE FOR ADULT FINANCIAL HANDLING.

### THIS MONTH VIEW
- ESTIMATED INCOME (BY SOURCE: DSP, GIGS, SYNC, DIRECT SUPPORT)
- TOP TRACKS BY EARNINGS

### TRENDS
- LAST 30 / 90 DAYS QUICK COMPARISON

### ACTIONS
- [EXPORT TO VAIVE MADE EASY]
- [SEE MISSING MONEY / UNMATCHED USAGE]

### KEY RULE
ARTISTS DON'T SEE RAW PRO SPREADSHEETS.
THEY SEE: "THIS IS ROUGHLY WHAT YOUR MUSIC IS DOING."

---

## TAB 4: 🤖 SUPPORT (24/7)

> "NOIZY.AI HAS YOUR BACK. ALWAYS."

### PURPOSE
THE TAB WHERE THE MAGIC LIVES.
NOIZY.AI ASSIST – 24/7 ARTIST SIDEKICK.

### WHAT THEY CAN ASK

#### CREATIVE
- "HELP ME WRITE A SECOND VERSE FOR THIS IDEA."
- "GIVE ME 5 ALTERNATE TITLES FOR THIS TRACK."
- "TURN THIS POEM INTO A LYRIC."

#### ORGANIZATIONAL
- "WHO PLAYED GUITAR ON 'SKY BETWEEN BUILDINGS' AGAIN?"
- "WHAT DID WE AGREE ON SPLITS FOR THAT EP?"
- "SHOW ME ALL IDEAS TAGGED 'CHORUS' FROM THE LAST MONTH."

#### PLANNING
- "WHAT SHOULD I FOCUS ON THIS WEEK?"
- "HELP ME PLAN A SIMPLE RELEASE STRATEGY FOR THIS SINGLE."

#### RIGHTS
- "HOW SHOULD I SPLIT THIS TRACK: ME (PRODUCER) + SINGER + CO-WRITER?"
- "WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COMPOSITION AND MASTER AGAIN?"

#### EMOTIONAL / FLOW
- "I'M STUCK. GIVE ME A SMALL CREATIVE EXERCISE."
- "GIVE ME 3 PROMPTS TO WRITE SOMETHING ABOUT GRIEF/JOY/FUTURE."

### WHAT NOIZY.AI ASSIST IS
**COACH · ASSISTANT · LIBRARIAN · RIGHTS NERD**
ROLLED INTO ONE CHAT WINDOW.

---

## THE ARTIST EXPERIENCE

### SAFE CONTAINER
- NO IDEA IS "TOO SMALL" OR "TOO DUMB"
- EVERYTHING CAN BE CAPTURED AND LABELED LATER

### REMEMBERING BRAIN
- "WHAT WERE THOSE CHORDS I LIKED LAST MONTH?"
- "SHOW ME THAT HALF-WRITTEN POEM ABOUT RAIN AND NEON."

### PROTECTOR
- "MAKE SURE THESE COLLABORATORS ARE IN THE CREDITS."
- "REMIND ME TO TALK TO [NAME] ABOUT SPLITS ONCE DEMO IS DONE."

### BRIDGE TO REAL-WORLD SUPPORT
- "YOU'VE MADE $X THIS QUARTER. WANT TO SEND THIS TO VAIVE MADE EASY?"
- "HERE'S A LIST OF QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR ACCOUNTANT."
