## LINKEDIN PERSONAL PROFILE (ABOUT)

```
I'M ROB (RSP), AND MY HEAD IS FULL OF SYSTEMS, SOUND, AND FUTURES THAT DON'T QUITE EXIST YET.

NOIZYLAB IS MY SMALL, FOCUSED STUDIO WHERE I:
– TURN CHAOTIC COMPUTERS INTO CALM, BORINGLY RELIABLE TOOLS
– GIVE OLD MUSIC AND AUDIO A SECOND LIFE (2NDLIFE / FISHMUSICINC)
– HELP FAMILIES CAPTURE VOICES AND STORIES BEFORE THEY VANISH (HERITAGE)

A NECK INJURY FORCED ME TO DESIGN WORKFLOWS THAT RESPECT MY BODY AND ENERGY.
NOW I BUILD THOSE KINDS OF FUTURE-READY, ACCESSIBLE SYSTEMS FOR OTHER PEOPLE:
CREATORS, SMALL BUSINESSES, AND FAMILIES.

IF YOUR TECH, YOUR AUDIO, OR YOUR DAYS FEEL TOO LOUD, I HELP BRING THEM BACK TO CALM.
```

# 4 CONTENT PILLARS

Everything you post falls into one of these buckets:

| Pillar | Tagline |
|--------|---------|
| **CALM TECH** | "I make your computer boring again." |
| **SECOND-LIFE SOUND / 2NDLIFE** | "Old sound, new life, same soul." |
| **HERITAGE / VOICES** | "Voices that don't vanish." |
| **FUTURE ROB / ACCESSIBILITY / IDEAS** | "I fix today with ideas from tomorrow." |

That's it. You don't owe the algorithm anything else.

# 4 POST TEMPLATES

---

## TEMPLATE 1 – CASE FILE POST
**Use for:** IG / FB / LinkedIn
**Structure:** Hook (pain) → What you did → How it feels now → Soft CTA

### EXAMPLE – CALM TECH:

```
CASE FILE: THE PANIC MAC

CLIENT: FREELANCE DESIGNER.
PROBLEM: CONSTANT BEACHBALL, NO BACKUP, "IF THIS DIES I'M DONE."

WHAT I DID:
– RAN A FULL HEALTH + STORAGE CHECK
– CLEANED YEARS OF JUNK AND STARTUP NOISE
– SET UP RELIABLE BACKUPS AND SAFE UPDATES

RESULT:
– FASTER BOOT
– QUIETER, PREDICTABLE BEHAVIOUR
– "I DON'T THINK ABOUT MY COMPUTER ANYMORE. IT JUST WORKS."

IF YOUR MACHINE FEELS LIKE THIS, THAT'S WHAT NOIZYLAB CALLS A CALM TECH RESET.
```

*Swap the details every time.*

---

## TEMPLATE 2 – ONE FIX, ONE LESSON
**Use for:** IG post / X tweet
**Structure:** What was broken → What you did → Lesson for everyone

### EXAMPLE – 2NDLIFE:

```
TODAY'S 2NDLIFE MOMENT:

A CLIENT'S FAVOURITE SONG WAS STUCK IN A 2008 MIX: THIN, QUIET, AND BURIED.
I GAVE IT A MODERN PASS: BALANCE, TONE, LOUDNESS, A LITTLE ANALOG LOVE.

LESSON:
THE SONG IS ALMOST NEVER THE PROBLEM.
THE ERA, THE GEAR, AND THE EARS WERE.

OLD SOUND. NEW LIFE. SAME SOUL.
```

---

## TEMPLATE 3 – HERITAGE STORY
**Use for:** IG / FB / LinkedIn (emotional)

### EXAMPLE:

```
WE RECORDED A GRANDMOTHER TODAY.

NOTHING FANCY. JUST A RELAXED CONVERSATION, A FEW GOOD QUESTIONS, AND HER VOICE FILLING THE ROOM.

WE CAPTURED HER LAUGH, THE WAY SHE SAID THEIR NAMES, THE LITTLE PAUSES WHEN SHE WENT BACK IN TIME.

WHEN WE PLAYED IT BACK, HER FAMILY WENT QUIET.

VOICES FADE. RECORDINGS DON'T. CAPTURE THEM NOW.
THAT'S WHAT HERITAGE IS FOR.
```

*You can write "we" even though it's you + your AI crew.*

---

## TEMPLATE 4 – QUOTE CARD
**Use for:** Super easy content – text on image + same text in caption

### EXAMPLES:

```
ALL THE VIVID COLOURS AND ALL SUCH BEAUTY, SWIMMING AROUND IN MY HEAD…
JUST WAITING TO STEP FORWARD INTO THE LIGHT AND HAVE THEIR MOMENT.
– RSP, NOIZYLAB
```

```
IF IDEAS ARE THE NEW COMMERCE, THEN I AM RICH BEYOND BELIEF.
```

```
I FIX TODAY WITH IDEAS FROM TOMORROW.
```

```
OLD SOUND. NEW LIFE. SAME SOUL.
```

```
VOICES FADE. RECORDINGS DON'T. CAPTURE THEM NOW.
```

```
MY BODY HAS LIMITS. MY IMAGINATION DOESN'T.
```

*Evergreen. Post again months later.*

# LOW-EFFORT RHYTHM

**Bare minimum (still looks serious):**

| Frequency | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| 1x / week | Case File OR One Fix, One Lesson |
| 1x / week | Quote Card OR Heritage Story |

**That's 2 posts/week total, maximum.**

Everything else is bonus.

When you finish a client job or a cool idea hits → turn it into one of these templates → done.
