NoizyLab is where those colours go to work.

I fix today with ideas from tomorrow: turning chaotic computers into calm tools, forgotten music into second lives, and fragile family moments into voices that don't vanish.

If your tech, your audio, or your days feel louder than they should, this is where things start getting quieter.

---

## WHAT NOIZYLAB IS

NoizyLab is my small, focused studio for three things:

**CALM TECH** – I turn messy, unreliable computers into boringly stable companions.

**SECOND-LIFE SOUND** – I revive old tracks, sessions, and catalogs so they finally sound like you always hoped they would.

**HERITAGE AUDIO** – I help you capture the voices and stories you'll wish you still had, years from now.

You don't need the perfect words. You just need to know which of these sounds like you:

- **"MY COMPUTER IS STRESSING ME OUT."**
- **"MY OLD MUSIC DESERVES A SECOND LIFE."**
- **"I WANT TO SAVE MY FAMILY'S VOICES."**

Pick a door. I'll handle the rest.

## DOOR ONE: MY COMPUTER IS STRESSING ME OUT

### NOIZYLAB CALM TECH RESET

Your computer shouldn't feel like a bomb with a spinning beachball. It should be a quiet tool that just… works.

**WHAT I DO:**

I perform a Calm Tech Reset on your machine:

- Full health check and triage
- Deep clean and performance tuning
- Safe, sensible updates (no "everything broke" horror story)
- Backup setup or repair, so you're not one failure away from disaster
- A simple report in human language: what was wrong, what I did, and how to keep it calm

**WHO THIS IS FOR:**

- People who rely on their computer for work or creative output
- Families with the "one family computer" holding photos, documents, and memories
- Anyone living with a machine that feels slow, noisy, fragile, or untrustworthy

If your setup feels like a constant anxiety source, I turn it into quiet infrastructure in the background of your life.

## DOOR TWO: MY OLD MUSIC DESERVES A SECOND LIFE

### 2NDLIFE – OLD SOUND, NEW LIFE, SAME SOUL

Some of your best ideas are stuck in old drives, strange formats, and mixes you grew out of. 2NDLIFE exists to bring those ideas into the present without losing their soul.

**WHAT I OFFER:**

**QUICK RESURRECTION**
For 1–2 songs that still matter to you.
I clean them up, modernize tone and loudness, and give you before/after versions so you can hear the difference.

**CATALOG REVIVAL**
For EPs, albums, and era-folders.
I refresh tone, stabilize levels, and bring coherence across tracks so your old work feels like it was made yesterday, not two operating systems ago.

**ANALOG 2NDLIFE SESSION**
For special projects and gear lovers.
I route selected tracks through real analog hardware for colour, glue, and warmth, then deliver versions that feel alive again.

**WHO THIS IS FOR:**

- Artists and producers with hard drives full of "almosts" and "not yet"
- Bands with back catalogs that never got a proper modern pass
- Creators who weren't wrong—the world just wasn't ready yet

Your 2003 mix with 2025 ears. The song was never the problem. The era was.

## DOOR THREE: I WANT TO SAVE MY FAMILY'S VOICES

### HERITAGE – VOICES THAT DON'T VANISH

One day, the people you love will only exist in memories. Their voice, their laugh, the way they tell the stories? That's the part that disappears fastest.

Heritage sessions give your family something real to hold onto: a voice that still speaks, long after time has done its thing.

**WHAT A HERITAGE SESSION IS:**

- A gentle, guided conversation with a parent, grandparent, or loved one
- A mix of structured prompts and open stories, tailored to them
- Recorded, cleaned, and delivered as audio you can back up and share
- Optionally paired with a simple transcript so future generations can both hear and read them

This isn't about big production or perfect answers. It's about capturing the way they truly sound—so the people who come after you can still sit with that voice.

**WHY IT MATTERS:**

> **VOICES FADE. RECORDINGS DON'T. CAPTURE THEM NOW.**

---

## CASE FILES

Real work. Names changed, impact not.

---

### CASE 01 – THE CRASHING LAPTOP

A designer's Mac was beachballing every few minutes. No backup, constant fear it would die mid-project.

**AFTER CALM TECH:**
Faster boot, junk cleared, safer update path, backups running quietly in the background.

> "IT FEELS LIKE MY COMPUTER GOT A NERVOUS SYSTEM TRANSPLANT."

---

### CASE 02 – THE LOST ALBUM

A band had an old EP that never quite landed. The mixes were thin, quiet, and stuck on an aging drive.

**AFTER 2NDLIFE:**
Refreshed mixes, proper loudness, cohesive tone across tracks, and a ready-to-release folder.

> "IT SOUNDS LIKE WE ALWAYS HOPED IT WOULD."

---

### CASE 03 – THE GRANDMOTHER'S VOICE

A family wanted more than photos. Their grandmother was getting frail; stories were slipping away.

**AFTER HERITAGE:**
One relaxed session, captured and cleaned. Audio backed up in multiple places and shared with the whole family.

> "WE DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH WE NEEDED THIS UNTIL WE HEARD IT."

## ABOUT RSP & NOIZYLAB

– RSP, NOIZYLAB
```

I'm Rob—RSP. My head is full of colour: systems, sounds, and futures that don't quite exist yet.

NoizyLab is how I let that colour out into the world.

- I design calm tech systems so your computer stops being the loudest thing in your day.
- I give old sound a second life, so your earlier work and memories don't stay trapped in obsolete tech.
- I help families keep their voices, so time doesn't erase the people who built you.

A neck injury changed how my body works and forced me to treat energy and ergonomics as sacred. I had to build systems that work with my limits instead of against them. Now I do the same for other people: creators, families, and anyone whose life happens around a screen and a sound.

If your world feels like static—tech chaos, half-finished audio, unrecorded stories—I'm the one who quietly starts tuning it back into something you can actually live with.

## WORK WITH NOIZYLAB

You don't have to explain everything perfectly. You just have to pick your door:

- **"MY COMPUTER IS STRESSING ME OUT."**
- **"MY OLD MUSIC DESERVES A SECOND LIFE."**
- **"I WANT TO SAVE MY FAMILY'S VOICES."**

Tell me:

- What's going on?
- Which of those is closest to your reality right now?
- How soon you need help?

I'll come back with a simple plan and options, not a wall of jargon.
