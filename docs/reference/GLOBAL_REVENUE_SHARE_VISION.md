### **The Beautiful Math:**

```
Example: NOIZY reaches $100,000/month revenue

Distribution:
├── $40,000 - Development & Operations
│   └── Keep building better tools for everyone
│
├── $30,000 - GLOBAL REVENUE SHARE POOL
│   ├── 10,000 active community members
│   └── Each receives $3/month
│      (Scales up as revenue grows!)
│
├── $20,000 - Community Programs
│   ├── Free tools for those who can't pay
│   ├── Educational programs
│   ├── Support services
│   └── Infrastructure
│
└── $10,000 - ART SAVES THE WORLD FUND
    ├── Grants for struggling artists
    ├── Equipment for underfunded schools
    ├── Support for communities in need
    ├── Emergency artist relief
    └── Global creative projects

At $1,000,000/month:
├── $300,000 shared among community
│   └── 100,000 members = $3 each
│       (Or tiered based on contribution)
│
└── $100,000 to ART SAVES THE WORLD
    = $1.2M/year to save the world through art!
```
