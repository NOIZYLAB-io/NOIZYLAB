# NOIZY.SHARE – GLOBAL INSTRUMENT & STUDIO ACCESS

> **"We're building a global instrument share with NOIZY.AI so kids of all ages can keep creating, and feel the love and joy that music gives — no matter where they were born or what's in their bank account."**
> – RSP

## THE CORE

**NOIZY.SHARE** – A global instrument & studio share program that gives people of all ages access to real instruments + NOIZY.AI.

**Nobody gets locked out of music because of money, geography, or disability.**

---

## THE THREE SHARES

### 1. INSTRUMENT SHARE
- Donated / retired instruments
- Refurbished + checked
- Matched to kids / adults who can't afford gear

### 2. STUDIO SHARE (NOIZY.AI)
- Free/discounted NOIZY.AI accounts for participants
- Pre-built "starter racks":
  - **Beat Lab** – drums, loops, rhythm
  - **Voice & Stories** – recording, spoken word, songwriting
  - **Ambient/Healing** – ASMR, calm textures, therapeutic sound
- **Accessibility-first**: works for people with mobility / neurodivergent needs

### 3. MENTOR SHARE
- Local musicians, retired players, teachers
- Short formats: 30–60 min sessions, in person or Zoom
- NOIZY.AI acts as:
  - Practice buddy
  - Idea generator
  - Memory / archive

---

## HOW IT WORKS

### STEP 1: COLLECT
- People donate instruments, mics, interfaces
- Music stores & studios add inventory
- Trade: tax receipt / credit / social recognition

### STEP 2: REFURB & CLASSIFY
- Basic repair / cleaning
- Tag each item:
  - Level (beginner / intermediate)
  - Suitable age/size
  - Condition
  - Special needs-friendly? (light touch, quiet, etc.)

### STEP 3: MATCHMAKING
Simple form:
- Who you are
- What you're curious about
- Any limitations (physical, sensory, financial)

NOIZY.AI helps recommend:
- Instrument type
- Starter path (beats, songwriting, sound design, etc.)

### STEP 4: ONBOARDING WITH NOIZY.AI
Each participant gets:
- Welcome from ENGR
- 3x starter "quests":
  1. **Make your first 8-bar loop**
  2. **Capture a sound from your world**
  3. **Make a song as a gift for someone you love**

### STEP 5: CREATE & SHARE
- Monthly "NOIZY.SHARE Sessions"
- Upload one track, loop, soundscape, ASMR piece
- Optional: global listening party / stream

### STEP 6: RETURN / KEEP / PASS-ON
After 6–12 months:
- **Keep** instrument (if life-changing), or
- **Pass it on** with a note / story for the next person

**Chain of love, not just logistics.**

## WHAT NOIZY.AI DOES HERE

### ON-RAMP FOR THE SHY / OVERWHELMED
- "I've never touched a synth" → guided flows
- "Show me three things I can do with this guitar tonight."

### ADAPTIVE FOR DISABLED / LIMITED-MOBILITY
- Voice-driven control
- Minimal hand movement workflows
- Templates designed for sensory comfort
- Gentle levels, slow textures, ASMR-friendly

### EMOTIONAL LAYER
ENGR asks:
- "Who are you making this for?"
- "What did today sound like to you?"

Turns that into prompts, structures, and rituals.

### ARCHIVE & CONTINUITY
- NOIZY.AI keeps their sounds, sketches, beats
- When life pulls them away, they can always come back
- Pick up the thread where they left off

---

## FIRST PILOT (START SMALL, PROVE IT)

### PILOT CITY: OTTAWA

### FIRST PARTNERS
- 1–2 local music stores
- 1–2 schools / community centers
- 1 disability / rehab organization

### MINIMAL VIABLE STACK
1. **One-page site**: What it is, Apply, Donate
2. **Intake form**: Donors / Recipients
3. **Simple tracker**: Notion or Airtable
4. **Welcome script**: NOIZY.AI x ENGR for new participants

---

## WHO THIS IS FOR

### KIDS (ACTUAL KIDS)
- Can't afford instruments
- No music program at school
- Curious but no access

### KIDS OF ALL AGES
- Adults who never got the chance
- Seniors who want to start or restart
- Anyone who feels "too late"

### PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
- Physical limitations
- Neurodivergent needs
- Sensory sensitivities
- **Every nervous system matters**

### ANYONE LOCKED OUT
- Geography (rural, remote)
- Money (can't afford gear)
- Circumstance (foster care, shelters, hospitals)

---

## THE VALUES (SAME FLOW)

### 1. MUSIC IS FOR EVERYONE
Not just people who can afford it.

### 2. INSTRUMENTS SHOULD BE PLAYED
Not sitting in closets.

### 3. KNOWLEDGE SHOULD BE SHARED
Not hoarded.

### 4. ACCESSIBILITY IS DEFAULT
Not an afterthought.

### 5. GIVE BACK WHEN YOU CAN
The chain continues.
