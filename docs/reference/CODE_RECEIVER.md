# 🟣 CODE RECEIVER — Ready to Process

## Process Flow

When you send code, GABRIEL will:

1. **TEST** ✅ - Validate syntax and structure
2. **HARVEST** 🔍 - Extract patterns, dependencies, functions, classes
3. **OPTIMIZE** ⚡ - Clean and optimize code
4. **ABSORB** 📦 - Determine best location in codebase
5. **MOVE/COPY** 📁 - Place code in organized structure
6. **DELETE** 🗑️ - Remove old/duplicate code (optional)

## Ready to Receive

Just paste your code and I'll process it through the complete lifecycle!

Example:
```
export class MyNewFeature {
  // Your code here
}
```

I'll automatically:
- Test it
- Extract all patterns
- Optimize it
- Find the right place for it
- Move/copy it there
- Clean up if needed

**Ready when you are!** 🚀
