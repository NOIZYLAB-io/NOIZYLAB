# SECTION 2: WHAT NOIZYLAB DOES

## WHAT NOIZYLAB DOES

**I FIX TODAY WITH IDEAS FROM TOMORROW.**

NoizyLab is my small, focused studio for three things:

- **CALM TECH** – turning messy, unreliable computers into boringly stable tools.
- **SECOND-LIFE SOUND** – reviving old tracks, projects, and catalogs so they finally hit like they should.
- **HERITAGE AUDIO** – helping families capture voices and stories before time takes them away.

If your tech, your audio, or your days feel noisier than they should, that's where I go to work.

# SECTION 3: THE 3 DOORS

---

## DOOR 1: MY COMPUTER IS STRESSING ME OUT

### NOIZYLAB CALM TECH RESET

I make your computer boring again—in the best way.

**INCLUDES:**
- Health check and triage
- Deep clean and performance tuning
- Safe updates (no "I broke everything" moments)
- Backup setup or fix
- Simple, human report: what was wrong, what I did, and how to keep it calm

**WHO IT'S FOR:**
- People who rely on their computer for work or creativity
- Families with "the one family computer" holding everything
- Anyone tired of living one crash away from panic

If your machine feels like a ticking time bomb, I turn it into quiet, predictable infrastructure.

---

## DOOR 2: MY OLD MUSIC DESERVES A SECOND LIFE

### 2NDLIFE – OLD SOUND, NEW LIFE, SAME SOUL

I take the tracks you left behind—old mixes, demos, half-finished albums—and give them a second life.

**OFFERS:**
- **QUICK RESURRECTION** – 1–2 songs cleaned, modernized, and leveled
- **CATALOG REVIVAL** – albums / eras rebuilt for today's listening world
- **ANALOG 2NDLIFE SESSION** – running select tracks through real hardware for colour and glue

**WHO IT'S FOR:**
- Artists and producers with a hard drive full of "almosts"
- Bands with a back catalog stuck in old formats
- Creators who were too early for their own ideas

Your 2003 mix with 2025 ears. The song wasn't the problem. The era was.

---

## DOOR 3: I WANT TO SAVE MY FAMILY'S VOICES

### HERITAGE – VOICES THAT DON'T VANISH

One day, every voice you love will be a memory.
Heritage sessions turn those voices into something your family can actually keep.

**WHAT I DO:**
- Gently guide a recorded conversation with a parent, grandparent, or loved one
- Mix in structured prompts and freeflow stories
- Deliver clean audio and a simple transcript you can share and backup

**WHY IT MATTERS:**

> **VOICES FADE. RECORDINGS DON'T. CAPTURE THEM NOW.**

It's not about production. It's about making sure future you can still hear them.

---

# SECTION 4: CASE FILES

## CASE FILES

Real stories. Names changed, results not.

---

### CASE 01 – THE CRASHING LAPTOP

Graphic designer. Mac was beachballing every few minutes, no backup, constant anxiety.

**AFTER CALM TECH:** 40% faster boot, junk cleared, backups running, clear plan.

> "IT FEELS LIKE MY COMPUTER GOT A NERVOUS SYSTEM TRANSPLANT."

---

### CASE 02 – THE LOST ALBUM

Band had an old EP that never quite hit. Mixes were thin, quiet, and stuck on an ancient drive.

**AFTER 2NDLIFE:** refreshed mixes, proper loudness, consistent tone, ready for re-release.

> "IT SOUNDS LIKE WE ALWAYS HOPED IT WOULD."

---

### CASE 03 – THE GRANDMOTHER'S VOICE

Family wanted something more real than photos. Grandmother was getting frail, stories fading.

**AFTER HERITAGE SESSION:** one relaxed conversation captured, cleaned audio + transcript, backed up in multiple places.

> "WE DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH WE NEEDED THIS UNTIL WE HEARD IT."

# SECTION 5: ABOUT RSP & NOIZYLAB

## ABOUT RSP & NOIZYLAB

```
ALL THE VIVID COLOURS AND ALL SUCH BEAUTY, SWIMMING AROUND IN MY HEAD…
JUST WAITING TO STEP FORWARD INTO THE LIGHT AND HAVE THEIR MOMENT.

– RSP, NOIZYLAB
```

I'm Rob (RSP). My head is full of colour: systems, sounds, and futures that don't quite exist yet.

NoizyLab is how I let that out into the world.

- **I FIX TODAY WITH IDEAS FROM TOMORROW.**
- **I TURN CHAOS INTO CALM SYSTEMS THAT JUST KEEP WORKING.**
- **I GIVE OLD SOUND A SECOND LIFE WITHOUT LOSING ITS SOUL.**

A neck injury forced me to build workflows and setups that respect my body and my energy. Now I build that sort of future-proof calm for other people too.

If your computer, your audio, or your life around them feels louder than it should, I can help bring it back to something you can live with.
