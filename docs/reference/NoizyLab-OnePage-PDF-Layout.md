## BLOCK 3 – WHAT NOIZYLAB IS
**Position:** Full-width, left-aligned
**Style:** Short intro + bullet points

### WHAT NOIZYLAB IS

NoizyLab is my small, focused studio for three things:

- **CALM TECH** – turning messy, unreliable computers into boringly stable companions.
- **SECOND-LIFE SOUND** – reviving old tracks, sessions, and catalogs so they finally sound like you always hoped they would.
- **HERITAGE AUDIO** – helping you capture the voices and stories you'll wish you still had, years from now.

You don't need the perfect words. You just need to know which of these sounds like you:

- **"MY COMPUTER IS STRESSING ME OUT."**
- **"MY OLD MUSIC DESERVES A SECOND LIFE."**
- **"I WANT TO SAVE MY FAMILY'S VOICES."**

---

## BLOCK 4 – THE 3 DOORS (THREE COLUMNS)
**Position:** 3 vertical cards/columns across the page
**Style:** Each has heading, subheading, bullets

---

### COLUMN 1 – CALM TECH

**DOOR 1 · MY COMPUTER IS STRESSING ME OUT**

**NOIZYLAB CALM TECH RESET**

Your computer shouldn't feel like a bomb with a spinning beachball. It should be a quiet tool that just works.

**WHAT I DO**
- Full health check and triage
- Deep clean and performance tuning
- Safe, sensible updates
- Backup setup or repair
- Simple, human report of what was wrong and what changed

**WHO IT'S FOR**

---

### COLUMN 2 – 2NDLIFE

**DOOR 2 · MY OLD MUSIC DESERVES A SECOND LIFE**

**2NDLIFE – OLD SOUND, NEW LIFE, SAME SOUL**

Some of your best ideas are stuck in old drives and outdated mixes. 2NDLIFE brings them into the present without losing their soul.

**WHAT I OFFER**
- **Quick Resurrection** – 1–2 songs refreshed and modernized
- **Catalog Revival** – EPs / albums rebuilt for today's listening world
- **Analog 2NDLIFE Session** – select tracks run through real hardware for colour and glue

**WHO IT'S FOR**

---

### COLUMN 3 – HERITAGE

**DOOR 3 · I WANT TO SAVE MY FAMILY'S VOICES**

**HERITAGE – VOICES THAT DON'T VANISH**

One day, the people you love will only exist in memories. Their voice disappears fastest.

**WHAT A SESSION IS**
- A gentle, guided conversation with a loved one
- Structured prompts plus natural storytelling
- Clean audio delivered, with an optional simple transcript

**WHY IT MATTERS**

> **VOICES FADE. RECORDINGS DON'T. CAPTURE THEM NOW.**

---

## BLOCK 5 – CASE FILES
**Position:** Full-width, 2 columns or stacked cards
**Style:** Keep each case short

### CASE FILES

---

**CASE 01 – THE CRASHING LAPTOP**

A designer's Mac was freezing and beachballing every few minutes. No backup, constant fear it would die mid-project.

**AFTER CALM TECH:** faster boot, junk cleared, safe updates, backups running quietly in the background.

> "IT FEELS LIKE MY COMPUTER GOT A NERVOUS SYSTEM TRANSPLANT."

---

**CASE 02 – THE LOST ALBUM**

A band had an old EP that never quite landed. The mixes were thin, quiet, and stuck on an aging drive.

**AFTER 2NDLIFE:** refreshed mixes, proper loudness, cohesive tone across tracks, and a ready-to-release folder.

> "IT SOUNDS LIKE WE ALWAYS HOPED IT WOULD."

---

**CASE 03 – THE GRANDMOTHER'S VOICE**

A family wanted more than photos. Their grandmother was getting frail; stories were slipping away.

**AFTER HERITAGE:** one relaxed session, captured and cleaned. Audio backed up in multiple places and shared with the whole family.

> "WE DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH WE NEEDED THIS UNTIL WE HEARD IT."

---

## BLOCK 6 – ABOUT RSP
**Position:** Full-width, left-aligned
**Style:** Short, personal, warm

### ABOUT RSP & NOIZYLAB

I'm Rob – RSP. My head is full of colour: systems, sounds, and futures that don't quite exist yet. NoizyLab is how I let that colour out into the world.

- I design calm tech systems so your computer stops being the loudest thing in your day.
- I give old sound a second life so your earlier work and memories don't stay trapped in obsolete tech.
- I help families keep their voices so time doesn't erase the people who built you.

A neck injury changed how my body works and forced me to treat energy and ergonomics as sacred. I had to build systems that work with my limits instead of against them. Now I do the same for other people.

If your world feels like static—tech chaos, half-finished audio, unrecorded stories—I'm the one who quietly starts tuning it back into something you can live with.
