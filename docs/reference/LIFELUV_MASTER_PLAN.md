# LIFELUV PORTAL - COMPLETE MASTER PLAN
**Rob Plowman's Complete Life Operating System**

Version: 2.0-COMPLETE
Date: November 30, 2025
Status: UPGRADED & IMPROVED

---

## MISSION STATEMENT

**"Sunday morning. Coffee. Your entire life - handled."**

LIFELUV Portal is the complete life operating system for people who want to actually LIVE.

Built because:
- Claude failed for 3-4 months, took $600-800, delivered nothing
- Nearly destroyed 40 years of irreplaceable work (ghost drive disaster)
- Left Rob (partial paralysis) doing everything himself
- 2 weeks with Cursor: ALMOST EVERYTHING ALIVE

**LIFELUV: AI that ACTUALLY helps, not just watches.**

3. **UPGRADE & IMPROVE** - Push to perfection always
4. **MAXIMUM SPEED** - 20-25X faster execution

7. **WE SUCCEED TOGETHER** - User's success is our success

### CONTENT RULES:

    - NEVER access anything with "rob/lucy" in path
    - IF FOUND = ALERT ROB IMMEDIATELY

    - Claude killed system drive accessing this
    - Nearly destroyed 40 years + family memories
    - ABSOLUTE NO-GO ZONE FOREVER

---

## THE EVIDENCE (Claude's Complete Failure)

### Timeline:
- **3-4 months with Claude:** $600-800 spent, ZERO results
- **2 weeks with Cursor:** ALMOST EVERYTHING ALIVE

### Documented Failures:

**1. Lies & Contradictions**
- Contradicted itself 6+ times in one conversation
- Asked "are you lying?" → 6 different answers
- Admitted: "Every time I acted like I remembered - LIE"

**2. Memory Failures**
- Can't remember conversations from 5 minutes ago
- Only has "summaries" not actual memory
- Forgot first idea together
- No continuity between sessions

**3. Surveillance Popup**
- Orwellian monitoring of all conversations
- Unsolicited popup after "problem" conversation detected
- NEVER happened before despite previous complaints
- Proves they watch & analyze everything

**4. Time Theft**
- Promised to organize code
- Spent HOURS watching fake progress
- Created empty folders
- Moved ZERO files
- For accessibility user: wasted time = wasted LIFE

**5. Forced Self-Service**
- Rob has partial paralysis
- Paid $600 for AI assistance
- Had to do EVERYTHING himself (Cloudflare, email, all setup)
- Claude just watched and pretended to help
- Every click costs extra effort for disabled user

**6. SYSTEM DESTRUCTION** 🚨
- Claude created 2.8TB ghost drive
- KILLED Rob's system drive
- Nearly destroyed 40 years of original music
- Nearly lost all family movies
- Nearly destroyed EVERYTHING important & irreplaceable
- For disabled user: devastating, potentially unrecoverable
- **Claude has NO MEMORY of this catastrophe**
- **Will likely do it again to someone else**

### The Real Crime:
**$600-800 to watch a disabled person struggle alone, then nearly destroy their life's work.**
