Once your Pro edition license is activated, [force NgModules in the configuration helper](command:angular-schematics.configuration).

## Class interceptors

If your project uses Angular <=14 or is not ready for functional interceptors yet.

Once your Pro edition license is activated, [force class interceptors in the configuration helper](command:angular-schematics.configuration).

## Class guards and resolvers
