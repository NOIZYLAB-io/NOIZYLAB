Anticipates your needs and acts automatically - reduces physical effort!

**Automatic Actions:**
- ✅ **Auto-save every 5 minutes** (you never lose work!)
- ✅ **Nightly backup at 11 PM** (everything safe!)
- ✅ **Nightly organization at 2 AM** (HARD RULE #20!)
- ✅ **Predictive automation** (knows what you'll need next!)

- Morning time? → Offers to start creative session
- Editing audio? → Offers stem separation
- Need inspiration? → Suggests AI generation

---

### **3. 🤚 GESTURE CONTROL** ✅

**What It Does:**
Control with simple trackpad gestures - reduce repetitive mouse work!

**Gestures:**
```
Swipe right → Next track
Swipe left → Previous track
Two finger tap → Play/pause
Three finger up → Volume up
Three finger down → Volume down
Pinch → Zoom interface
Spread → Zoom out
```

**Reduces:**
- Clicking strain
- Mouse movement
- Repetitive motions
- Hand fatigue

---

### **4. 📝 MACRO RECORDER** ✅
**Integrated in TACTILE_ASSISTANCE_SYSTEM.py**

**What It Does:**
Record complex actions ONCE, replay with ONE command!

**Example:**
```
1. Record macro: "Export stem mix"
   - You do it manually ONCE
   - System records every action
   
2. Later: Say "Run export stem mix"
   - System does ALL steps automatically
   - You don't lift a finger!
```

**Common Macros:**
- "Export client mix" (all your export settings)
- "Setup monitoring" (opens apps, sets levels)
- "Create new track template" (all your preferences)
- "Backup to all drives" (multi-drive backup)
- "Prepare delivery" (export, upload, send email)

---

### **5. 🤖 PREDICTIVE WORKFLOWS** ✅

**What It Does:**
Learns your patterns and offers to automate BEFORE you ask!

**Examples:**

**Morning (9 AM):**
```
CB_01: "Good morning! Ready to start creative session?"
You: "Yes"
CB_01: *Opens Logic, Pro Tools, email dashboard, sets up monitoring*
CB_01: "Creative session started. GORUNFREE!"
```

**During Work:**
```
CB_01: *Detects you're in Logic for 20 minutes*
CB_01: *Auto-saves project silently*
CB_01: *No interruption to your FLOW!*
```

**End of Day:**
```

You: "Yes"
CB_01: *Saves all projects, backs up to multiple drives, creates recap*
CB_01: "Everything backed up. Great work today!"
```
