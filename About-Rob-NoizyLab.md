```
ALL THE VIVID COLOURS AND ALL SUCH BEAUTY, SWIMMING AROUND IN MY HEAD…
JUST WAITING TO STEP FORWARD INTO THE LIGHT AND HAVE THEIR MOMENT.

I'm Rob (RSP). My head is full of colour: sounds, systems, and futures that don't quite exist yet.

NoizyLab is how I let that out into the world.

I fix computers and workflows so they become calm, boringly reliable tools instead of constant emergencies. I revive old music and recordings so they can finally be heard the way they were meant to be. I help people capture voices and stories before time takes them away.

A neck injury forced me to build systems that respect my body, my energy, and my limits. Now I build that kind of future-leaning calm for other people too.

If your tech, your audio, or your days feel noisier than they should, that's where my colours go to work.

## WHAT I DO

- **CALM TECH** – I make computers boring again. Stable, backed up, stress-free.
- **2NDLIFE SOUND** – I give old tracks a second chance with fresh ears and modern tools.
- **HERITAGE AUDIO** – I help families capture voices before they're gone.

---

## HOW I WORK

- **I FIX TODAY WITH IDEAS FROM TOMORROW.**
- **I TURN CHAOS INTO CALM SYSTEMS THAT JUST KEEP WORKING.**
- **I GIVE OLD SOUND A SECOND LIFE WITHOUT LOSING ITS SOUL.**
