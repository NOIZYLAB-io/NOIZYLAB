# 🧹 Home Directory Cleanup Log

## Cleanup Date
**2024-11-22**

## Actions Taken

### ✅ Projects Moved to NOIZYLAB/
- ai-aggregator
- fishmusicinc-email-setup
- it_genius
- mta-sts-policies
- ultimate-ssh-system

### ✅ Scripts Moved to NOIZYLAB/scripts/
All script files (.sh, .py, .js, .rb, .pl) from home directory moved here.

### ✅ Miscellaneous Files Moved to NOIZYLAB/misc/
All other files and directories that don't belong to specific projects.

## Result

Your home directory (`/Users/m2ultra/`) is now clean and contains only:
- Standard macOS directories (Desktop, Documents, Downloads, etc.)
- System configuration files (.ssh, .vscode, etc. - remain in home)
- NOIZYLAB directory (all your projects and files)

## Access Your Files

All your projects, scripts, and files are now organized in:
```
/Users/m2ultra/NOIZYLAB/
├── [projects]/     # Your development projects
├── scripts/        # All scripts
├── config/         # Configuration files
├── misc/           # Miscellaneous files
└── archive/        # Archived items
```

## Quick Navigation

```bash
cd /Users/m2ultra/NOIZYLAB
cd scripts          # All scripts
cd misc             # Misc files
cd [project-name]   # Your projects
```

---

**Status**: ✅ Cleanup Complete
**Home Directory**: Clean as fresh OS install (except standard dirs + NOIZYLAB)
