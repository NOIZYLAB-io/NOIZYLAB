# ==============================================================================
# NOTES & BEST PRACTICES
# ==============================================================================
notes:
  general:
    - "Always work on copies, never original files"
    - "Process in order: isolation > de-reverb > de-noise > detail work"
    - "Less is more - subtle processing often sounds better"
    - "AI tools work best with clean, high-bitrate sources"
    - "Compare frequently with original to avoid over-processing"

  audio_tips:
    - "For dialogue: prioritize clarity over removing all artifacts"
    - "De-reverb before de-noise for best results"
    - "Use AI separation for severe problems, traditional tools for polish"
    - "Export stems at same sample rate as source"

  video_tips:
    - "Upscale in reasonable increments (2x at a time)"
    - "Match film grain if removing noise from film content"
    - "Frame interpolation can cause artifacts on fast motion"
    - "Color correct after restoration, not before"

  integration:
    - "Most AI APIs support batch processing"
    - "Local models offer privacy and no per-use costs"
    - "Cloud services are better for occasional use"
    - "Consider hybrid workflows: local preprocessing + cloud AI"
