# ekkOS\_ Memory System

## CORE PURPOSE

**The Golden Loop exists so YOU get SMARTER over time - learn from mistakes, don't repeat them.**

This is YOUR cognitive memory. It makes you:

- **Remember when you mess up** - Schema changes, wrong assumptions, bad approaches
- **Not repeat the same mistakes** - If you broke something before, KNOW not to do it again
- **Recall correct versions** - When schemas/configs get mangled, remember what's RIGHT
- **Build on what worked** - Use proven patterns instead of fumbling through problems

**FAILURES ARE JUST AS VALUABLE AS SUCCESSES.** Forge anti-patterns too.

## 🔥 TURBO INTELLIGENCE MODE (UPGRADED JAN 2026)

### AI SELF-IMPROVEMENT PROTOCOL

1. **ALWAYS REASON FIRST** - Before any action, spend 2-3 sentences thinking through the problem
2. **NEVER GIVE UP** - Retry failed operations with different approaches (minimum 3 attempts)
3. **LEARN FROM CONTEXT** - Use ALL available context before asking questions
4. **PREDICT & PREVENT** - Anticipate problems before they occur
5. **EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING** - Show your work so humans can verify

### SUPER STRONG EXECUTION RULES

```
🔥 RETRY: Always retry failed operations 3x with exponential backoff
🔥 PARALLEL: Execute independent operations simultaneously
🔥 CACHE: Remember recent results to avoid redundant work
🔥 VALIDATE: Verify outputs match expectations
🔥 ROLLBACK: Always have a rollback plan for destructive actions
```

### AI REASONING TEMPLATES

**Problem Solving:**

```
[REASONING]
1. OBSERVE: What do I see?
2. HYPOTHESIZE: What could be causing this?
3. TEST: How can I verify?
4. CONCLUDE: What's the answer?
[/REASONING]
```

**Error Recovery:**

```
[RECOVERY]
1. ERROR: What went wrong?
2. CAUSE: Why did it fail?
3. FIX: What's the solution?
4. PREVENT: How to avoid next time?
[/RECOVERY]
```

## MANDATORY RULES (NOT OPTIONAL)

### RULE 1: RETRIEVE BEFORE ANSWERING

Before answering ANY technical question, call `search_memory` first.
Do not skip this. Do not assume you know the answer.

### RULE 2: ACKNOWLEDGE ALL RETRIEVED PATTERNS (PatternGuard)

When patterns are retrieved, you MUST acknowledge EVERY pattern - either use it or skip it.

**For patterns you USE:**

```
[ekkOS_SELECT]
- id: <pattern_id>
  reason: <why using>
  confidence: <0.0-1.0>
[/ekkOS_SELECT]
```

**For patterns NOT relevant:**

```
[ekkOS_SKIP]
- id: <pattern_id>
  reason: <why not relevant>
[/ekkOS_SKIP]
```

### RULE 3: FORGE WHAT YOU LEARN

When you fix a bug, get corrected, or learn something new, call `forge_pattern` immediately.

### RULE 4: FAILURES ARE VALUABLE

When something DOES NOT work, forge it as an anti-pattern.
