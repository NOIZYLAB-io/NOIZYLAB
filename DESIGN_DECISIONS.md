## 1. Architecture

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC):**
  - The `src/` directory adopts an MVC pattern to organize application logic clearly.
  - This separation makes the project structure familiar to developers from frameworks like Angular, improving maintainability and scalability.

- **Webview Application:**
  - The `webview/` folder encapsulates the graphical interface using React and React Flow.
  - This ensures a modular and modern front-end experience for JSON visualization.

---

## 2. Key Features

- **JSON Visualization:**
  - Users can preview JSON structures graphically through the webview.
  - Decisions were made to integrate React Flow for an intuitive drag-and-drop experience.

- **Customizable Controls:**
  - The webview includes controls for zooming, rotating layouts, and toggling interactivity.
  - These features enhance usability for diverse workflows.

---

## 3. Technology Stack

- **Programming Languages:**
  - TypeScript is used across the project for type safety and modern JavaScript features.

- **Build Tools:**
  - Vite ensures fast builds and optimized development workflows.

- **Styling:**
  - Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach for consistent and maintainable styles.

- **Localization:**
  - All strings are stored in the `l10n/` directory to support multiple languages.

---

## 4. Design Principles

- **Separation of Concerns:**
  - Core logic resides in the `src/` folder, while visual components are isolated in `webview/`.

- **Scalability:**
  - The modular structure ensures that new features can be added without disrupting existing functionality.

- **User Experience:**
  - Emphasis on interactivity, responsiveness, and ease of use drives the design choices.

---

## 5. Notable Trade-offs

- **Automatic Imports:**
  - The extension does not automatically add imports to user projects.
  - This decision avoids unwanted changes in user codebases but requires users to manage imports manually.

- **Graphical Complexity:**
  - Advanced visual features, like conditional rendering, were deprioritized for the initial release to ensure stability.

---

## 6. Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Found in `src/test/`, these ensure that core logic operates as expected.

- **Integration Tests:**
  - Focused on the interaction between the extension and VS Code's API.

- **Manual Testing:**
  - Performed regularly to validate the user experience in real-world scenarios.

---

## 7. Future Considerations

- **Improved Logging:**
  - Conditional logging and grouped log outputs may be explored in future iterations.

- **Enhanced Visuals:**
  - Explore support for custom node designs and more dynamic layouts.

- **Plugin Ecosystem:**
  - Allow third-party developers to extend the visualization functionality.

## 8. Documentation

- All configurations and workflows are thoroughly documented in:
  - `README.md`
  - `USAGE_GUIDE.md`
  - `DEVELOPERS_GUIDE.md`

This document will be updated as new design decisions are made and implemented.
