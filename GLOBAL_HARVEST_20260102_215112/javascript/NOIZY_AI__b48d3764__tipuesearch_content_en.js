More information about iZotope’s Customer Care department and policies can be found in the iZotope Customer Care chapter. \n  Navigating the Interface The Ozone 9 plug-in interface is divided into four main areas as outlined in the image and table below.\n    Label Control Description      Global Header The global header area provides access to: the IPC plug-in name editor, Master Assistant features, the Preset Manager, Undo History, Options, and Help. See the Global Header section for more information.    Signal Chain The Signal Chain allows you to add or remove modules and adjust the processing order of modules included in the chain. This Signal Chain area is exclusive to the Ozone 9 mothership plug-in. Ozone 9 component plug-ins do not include this Signal Chain because they only include one processing module. See the Signal Chain section for more information.    Module Interface The module panel area includes all controls and meters associated with a specific processing module.    I/O Panel The I/O (Input/Output) panel area includes: global (I/O) gain controls, I/O metering, channel operations controls, and global bypass. See the I/O Panel section for more information.    Learn more about the I/O panel and Global header\nLearn more about the controls in the Global Header and I/O Panel in the General Controls chapter.\n  Signal Flow The following diagram represents the signal flow of the Ozone 9 Mothership plug-in and application.\n Signal Flow Caveats\n If the Maximizer or Vintage Limiter are in the signal chain and the DC Offset Filter is enabled in the Dither panel, then the DC offset filter is applied before those modules. Dither and Codec Preview are disabled by default. \n Working with the Signal Chain You can add, remove, and reorder modules in the Signal Chain area of the Ozone 9 mothership plug-in. By default, the Ozone 9 Signal Chain includes the EQ module and the Maximizer module.\nLearn more about the Signal Chain\nSee the General Controls chapter for more information about working with the Signal Chain.\n  Ozone Plug-ins and Application Throughout this manual, the terms \u0026ldquo;Mothership\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Component\u0026rdquo; are used to describe plug-ins included with Ozone 9 Standard or Advanced, and the term \u0026ldquo;Application\u0026rdquo; is used to describe the App version of Ozone 9 included with Ozone 9 Advanced.\n   OZONE PACKAGING DESCRIPTION     Mothership plug-in Refers to the main Ozone 9 plug-in that includes multiple processing modules in a single plug-in instance.   Component plug-in Refers to the plug-in equivalent of any individual module included in the Ozone Mothership plug-in, which allows for focused control over an individual processing module.   Application Refers to the application version of Ozone 9, including all functionality within the Ozone 9 mothership plug-in and DAW transport controls. See the Ozone Application chapter for more information.    SAVE ON CPU RESOURCES WITH COMPONENT PLUG-INS\nWhen working with a single processing module, component plug-ins can be used as resource-friendly alternatives to the mothership plug-in.\n Mothership \u0026amp; component plug-in feature differences\nThere are some features included in the Ozone 9 mothership plug-in that are not available in the Ozone 9 component plug-ins:\n Master Assistant feature Signal Chain Some I/O Panel controls: Sum To Mono, Swap, Reference, Dither, and Codec Preview. \n Tonal Balance Control Tonal Balance Control (TBC) is a metering plug-in included with Ozone 9 Advanced. TBC displays spectrum metering information for the track it is currently inserted on relative to a target curve, which can be useful when dealing with tonal balance issues that arise during mixing and mastering. TBC can help provide context and direction toward resolving issues with a mix or master lacking the low-end power or high-end brilliance found in professionally produced, radio-ready material. For more information on Tonal Balance Control, vist the Tonal Balance Control Help Documentaion.\n Workflow Suggestions There are a number of different ways to approach working with Ozone 9 plug-ins. We\u0026rsquo;ve included some workflow suggestions you can use if you aren\u0026rsquo;t sure where to start. These workflows are merely suggestions and any workflow is valid if it works for you.\nUsing Presets Ozone 9 plug-ins include a built in preset manager with a wide variety of factory presets to get you started.\nStart by listening through several of Ozone’s presets. The presets contain helpful descriptions based on the outcome they will produce on your audio. Alternatively, you can start with a genre-based mastering preset, or simply use the general-purpose mastering presets. When you’ve found one that fits your project, you can start tweaking that preset to achieve your mastering goals.\nLearn more about the Preset Manager\nLearn more about accessing and working with the Ozone Preset Manager in the Presets chapter.\n Module Presets in the Ozone Mothership Plug-in\nThe Ozone mothership plug-in includes a global preset manager and a module preset manager. You can load presets that apply to a single module by clicking the Preset button in the module\u0026rsquo;s Signal Chain selector. For more information on this module card feature, see the Signal Chain section.\n Using the Master Assistant Feature The Ozone 9 mothership plug-in and Ozone Application offers intelligent assistive features aimed at helping you find a starting point for your Mastering workflow. You can access the Master Assistant feature by inserting a Ozone 9 mothership plug-in on your master bus or by opening the Ozone 9 Application and clicking on the Master Assistant button within the Global Header.\nLearn more about Master Assistant\nSee the Master Assistant chapter for more information about working with Master Assistant.\n  Working with IPC Wouldn’t it be cool if all the iZotope products you owned talked to each other? Well, it’s a dream come true! With iZotope’s Inter Plug-in Communication (IPC) technology, different iZotope plug-in instances on separate tracks can send data back and forth to each other.\nOzone 9 Advanced includes our Tonal Balance Control 2 IPC connection. This will allow you to monitor your Ozone 9 instances including mothership plug-ins and component plug-ins via Tonal Balance Control 2.\n Optimizing Performance With Ozone 9, you will experience improvements in performance compared to previous versions.\nThe most noticeable areas of improvement will be:\n CPU Usage Start-up time Real-time DSP  If you start to reach the limits of your particular machine, here are some things you can do to improve performance\n Remove any modules that are not in use from the signal chain. Ozone Advanced users: If you are only using one module in the mothership plug-in, consider using a component plug-in instead. If possible, increase the buffer size setting in your DAW. If using Ozone’s Digital EQ, adjust your EQ buffer sizes for optimal performance. See Buffer Sizes for details. If using the Digital crossover type in any multiband module, try adjusting the Crossover Buffer Size in the options menu. If using the Ozone plug-ins within a host application, try changing the buffer size and/or latency setting in the host application. Disable meters in their option screens. Using fewer crossover bands can save significant CPU power. Try using one- or two-band dynamics, for example, instead of all four bands.  Setting buffer sizes for independent modules Ozone’s Equalizer requires fixed buffers when set to certain modes. You can set its buffer size independently using its options tab. These buffer sizes default to reasonable values, and most users should be able to use Ozone right away without tweaking them.\nEvaluating host buffer sizes in Ozone You can use Ozone’s Buffer Size Viewer to evaluate what kinds of buffers the host application is sending to Ozone (only applicable in the Ozone plug-ins).\n  Open the View Buffers window in Ozone by navigating to: Options \u0026gt; General \u0026gt; Host \u0026gt; View Buffers. Once you know what size buffers your host application is sending, try the following:\n Add the EQ module to the signal chain and remove all other modules from the chain. Ensure the EQ module is set to ‘Digital’ mode. Set the EQ filter size to the size you most commonly use. Set the EQ buffer size to the number that’s closest to your host application buffer size (displayed in the View buffers window) Open a CPU meter. * Many host applications have a CPU meter built in, but if you’re running Windows you can also press Ctrl+Shift+ESC and select the Performance tab. Note that CPU meters are usually somewhat inaccurate, but we’re just looking for relative changes in CPU usage.    Add an audio file to the track with Ozone on it (or send the output of a track to the bus that Ozone is inserted on).\n Ensure the file you are using is similar to files you typically work with (ie. sampling rate, bit depth, number of channels). If you usually use Ozone in a multitrack environment then be sure to do the same here.    As the audio plays, try adjusting the EQ buffer size while monitoring the CPU meter, to see if certain buffer sizes have a positive effect on CPU consumption.\n Buffer sizes near the host application buffer size are a good starting point, but the best choice depends on many aspects of your system and host application.    Following the steps above ensures that Ozone’s CPU consumption is optimized for your current session parameters.\n  If you change your session configuration, for example, if you move from 44.1 kHz to 96 kHz, or you change from a single-track setup to a multi-track setup, then you may want to repeat these steps to make sure your buffer settings are still optimal.\n  ",

Meters The Input and Output meters display Peak and RMS metering information for the left and right channels.\n The current Peak value is displayed in white. The current RMS value is displayed in light grey.  The text readouts directly above the meters display the current Peak and RMS values.\nSetting Input and Output\nYou can adjust the input or output gain slider in two ways:\n Click and drag the slider UP or DOWN. Clicking on the sider and use your mouse wheel. \n Double-Click to Reset Gain slider\n If left and right sliders are locked, double-click on either slider to reset both of the left and right sliders to 0 dB. If left and right sliders are unlocked and set at different levels, double-click a specific slider to reset it to 0 dB. If the left and right sliders are locked but previously has been set to different levels, double-click on one slider to reset it to match the level of the other slider. Another double-click will reset both sliders to 0 dB. \n UNLINKED GAIN ADJUSTMENTS\nBy default, the left and right gain sliders are linked. When you move one of the level sliders, the other moves the other.\n You can adjust left and right gain independently by clicking on Link button below the I/O meters to disable linking. You can also offset the two channels and then re-link the gain sliders to make adjustments with the offset. The sliders will remember their offset, even if they are temporarily turned up or down all the way, so that when you bring the sliders back to the middle the offset will be preserved. \n Metering Options You are able to adjust several I/O metering options. There are two different I/O metering options:\n Open the I/O Options tab in the Options window. Click on the I/O button above the I/O meters to open the I/O Metering Options menu which has limited, but different options compared to the options available in the I/O Options tab.  The following options outlined in the image and table below are available via the I/O button.\n    OPTION DESCRIPTION     Type Select the type of I/O meter to display. For more information on the options available, see the Type Options section.   Source Select the audio source for the input/output meters. For more information on the options available, see the Source Options section.   Replace Input with Reference Enable to allow the Ozone input meter to display the reference track level. See the Reference chapter for more information.   Show Reference Spectrum Enable to allow Ozone to display the the Reference track spectrum in the module view alongside the spectrum of your current track and to allow the Ozone input meter to display the reference track level. See the Reference chapter for more information.    Type Options You can choose from the following audio monitoring types:\n   OPTION DESCRIPTION     RMS (Root Mean Square) A software-based implementation of an analog-style level meter. Using different integration times, you can model popular VU or PPM meters. The RMS meter displays the average level calculated over a short window of time. The RMS meter readout will typically be lower than an equivalent PPM meter (Digital/Analog), since it is averaging peaks into the overall loudness.   Peak A fast meter that measures instantaneous maximum sample value or peak analog waveform values, depending on the “detect inter-sample peaks” checkbox. If you are tracking the peaks for possible clipping, the Peak meter is appropriate.   RMS + Peak This is a combined RMS and Peak meter. This meter displays a lower bright bar representing the average level (RMS) and a higher dimmer bar representing peak level. There is also a moving line above the bar representing the most recent peak level or peak hold.   K-System Ozone 9 supports Bob Katz’s K-System metering with simultaneous peak and RMS displays.   Momentary This measurement is a calculation of loudness over the course of 400ms.   Short Term This measurement is a calculation of loudness over the course of 3 seconds.   Integrated This measurement is a calculation of loudness over the course of an indefinite period of time.    Source Options You can choose from the following source types:\n   OPTION DESCRIPTION     Stereo The default setting. When selected, displays meters in stereo format.   Mid/Side When selected, the meter in the center represents the Mid channel level information and the meters on the left and right represents Side channel level information.    LEFT AND RIGHT GAIN SLIDERS STAY SAME\nThe left and right gain sliders control the left and right gain of your signal, regardless of the Meter Source selection.\n  Module Channel Processing Ozone 9 offers different channel processing modes that determine how processing is applied in a selected module. The Ozone modules offer different channel processing options:\n   MODULE STEREO Mid/Side Left/Right     Dynamics X X    Dynamic EQ X X X   EQ X X X   Exciter X X    Spectral Shaper X X    Vintage Compressor X X    Vintage EQ X X X    Processing Modes You can choose from one of the following processing modes within the Module Channel Processing Mode dropdown menu as outlined in the image and table below.\n    MODE DESCRIPTION     Stereo Select to allow channel processing to be applied in stereo. This is the default processing mode for all modules including those that do not offer explicit channel processing options.   Mid/Side Select to allow channel processing to be applied in either the Mid and/or Side channels depending on your configuration of the Mid/Side controls.   Left/Right Select to allow channel processing to be applied in either the Left and/or Right channels depending on your configuration of the Left/Right    Mid/Side Controls Selecting Mid/Side mode exposes two sets of parameters allowing you to process the Mid and Side channels indepenently. One set of parameters applies processing to the encoded Mid channel and the second set of parameters applies processing to the encoded Side channels. These parameters are outlined in the table below.\n   ICON CONTROL DESCRIPTION      Power Button Toggle the power button OFF to bypass either Mid or Side channel processing.    Solo Solos the module\u0026rsquo;s Mid or Side channel processing.    Mid Enabled Select to independently view and adjust the parameters that affect the Mid channel processing of the active module.    Side Enabled Select to independently view and adjust the parameters that affect the Side channel processing in the active module.    Channel Link Enable to link the Mid \u0026amp; Side controls so that any parameter adjustments in the Mid channel will adjust the corresponding Side channel parameter and vice versa.    Mid/Side Metering Ozone\u0026rsquo;s I/O meters display Stereo information by default. To change the Input/Output meters to display Mid/Side metering information, click on the I/O button above the I/O meters and change \u0026ldquo;Source\u0026rdquo; selection to Mid/Side.\n When the I/O meters are in Mid/Side mode, the meter in the center represents the Mid channel level information and the meters on the left and right represents Side channel level information. The left and right gain sliders control the left and right gain of your signal, regardless of the Meter Source selection.\nMID/SIDE CHANNEL ENCODING \u0026amp; DECODING\nWhen Mid/Side mode is enabled, the input signal to the module is encoded into a Mid/Side configuration. After processing in Mid/Side mode, the signal is decoded from Mid/Side to Stereo at the output of the module.\n Mid Channel Encoding: The encoded Mid channel signal represents the phantom image between left \u0026amp; right speakers, or the center channel of the input audio. Side Channel Encoding: The encoded Side channel signal represents the sides (or edges) of the input audio. \n Left/Right Controls Selecting Left/Right mode exposes two sets of parameters allowing you to process the Left and Right channels indepenently by splitting the input signal to the module into two processing channels, Left \u0026amp; Right. The signal is then \u0026lsquo;summed\u0026rsquo; back to Stereo at the module\u0026rsquo;s output. One set of parameters applies processing to the Left channel and the second set of parameters applies processing to the Right channel. These parameters are outlined in the table below.\n   ICON CONTROL DESCRIPTION      Power Button Toggle the power button OFF to bypass either Left or Right channel processing.    Solo Solos the module\u0026rsquo;s Left or Right channel processing.    Left Enabled Select to independently view and adjust the parameters that affect the Left channel processing of the active module.    Right Enabled Select to independently view and adjust the parameters that affect the Right channel processing in the active module.    Channel Link Enable to link the Left and Right controls so that any parameter adjustments in the Left channel will adjust the corresponding Right channel parameter and vice versa.    Relative Parameter Linking Allows for relative linking of parameter values so that parameter values will be linked relative to their values at the time they are linked.\nRelative Linking Example\n Enable Mid/Side mode in the Exciter. Adjust Mid Channel: Band 1 Mix to 50%. Enable Mid/Side Link. Adjust Side Channel: Band 1 Mix to 75%. Return to Mid Channel view and notice that Mid Channel: Band 1 Mix is now set to 25%. \n  Plug-in Automation Automation allows you to specify changes to parameters over the duration of a mix, such as stereo widening during a chorus or boosting an EQ during a solo. You can automate hundreds of parameters within Ozone, using any host application that supports effects automation.\nUsing Automation in Ozone The following are general instructions for using automation within Ozone:\n Insert Ozone as an ordinary plug-in effect on a track. In the track view of the host app, assign automation envelopes to the track to control how Ozone\u0026rsquo;s parameters are changed over the course of the mix. Make adjustments in the track view of the host app, dragging curves and envelopes as opposed to changing controls within Ozone.  Refer to Host App Documentation\nThe implementation and specifics of automation are dependent on the host application. Please refer to the documentation of your host app for setting up an automated mix.\n Navigating Ozone Automation Parameter Names\nIt can be overwhelming when you initially see the very large list of automatable parameters within Ozone. While scrolling through the list, here are some tips to keep in mind:\n Each multiband module has up to 4 bands per parameter. For example,“Dynamics: Comp Thresh Band 1” corresponds to the Compressor Threshold setting in Band 1 of the Dynamics module. When automating parameters in the EQ module, the Stereo/Mid/Left parameters are labeled with the “St/M/L” prefix and Side/Right parameters are labeled with the “S/R” prefix. When automating a control from the track view, you can see the control on the Ozone interface move, under the control of the host application. We purposely do not update the position of the control as often as we could, as it takes CPU power to redraw controls, power that is ideally reserved for processing audio. So we update the drawing of the control less frequently. It may look like the control is moving in steps, but rest assured that the audio is being processed smoothly. \n ",

See the tables below for more information on each of these methods.\n   CLICK \u0026amp; DRAG CUTOFF HANDLES     1. Hover over the crossover node to reveal the node handles.   2. Left-click and drag the handle LEFT or RIGHT to the desired position.   3. While dragging, use the frequency readout at the bottom of the handle as the reference to where the crossover point is in relation to frequency.       ENTER TEXT INPUT     1. Double-click on a crossover handle to open the readout as a text edit field.   2. Type the desired frequency value for the crossover cutoff into this field.   3. Hit the enter or return key to update the value.    Crossover Points Only Affect Active Module\nCrossover cutoff points are not shared across multiband modules. Adjusting a crossover point in one module will not affect the crossover points in the other multiband modules.\n Compressor Detection Filter\nYou can Solo the dry output (pre-processing) of a frequency band by bypassing and soloing the band at the same time. This can be useful for auditioning the affect of an individual band\u0026rsquo;s processing.\n Adding Crossovers\nIf a crossover exists at the point you right-clicked on, the new crossover cutoff will be placed to the right of the existing cutoff.\n  Detailed Band Enable to view the basic parameter values for each band via the HUD display overlaid on the spectrum. This is the default view for the EQ module.\n Parameter Adjustments You can adjust the parameter values for any band by using the band node adjustments. For more information on the parameters and readouts with this view see the EQ module chapter.\n Detection Filter Enable this view to adjust the frequency response of the detection circuit. When the Detection Filter is active, you can access the controls outlined in the table and image below. Detection filter processing is included in the Dynamics module and Vintage Compressor module\n The following controls are available in the Detection Filter view for the Dynamics module:\n    LABEL CONTROL DESCRIPTION      Solo Enable to audition the input signal of the detection filter. This allows you to listen to only the signal that is triggering processing within the Dynamics module.    None No filter is applied to the dynamics module detection circuit.    Highpass A high-pass filter is applied to the dynamics detection circuit.    Tilt Similar to the THRUST circuit found on API compressors, Tilt mode preserves low frequencies using a high-frequency weighted filter curve. Adjust the Amount by clicking and entering a value into the text-field to modify the slope of the Tilt filter.    Resonant Filter Nodes Adjusts gain and center frequency in low-pass bands and high-pass bands.    Slope Click on the Slope value readout to toggle between the different Slope values. The Highpass detection filter includes the following Slope options: 6 dB, 12 dB, 24 dB, 48 dB. Click and drag the frequency node to adjust the frequency of the highpass filter.    Vintage Compressor Detection Filter Mode Controls\nThe Detection Filter controls available in the Vintage Compressor are limited to a Solo button and three Resonant Nodes each placed in the low, mid, and high region of your spectrum display.\n Resonant Filter Node Adjustments The Resonant Filter Nodes are displayed within the the Detection Filter view. You can use these to tailor your frequency response.\n   PARAMETER ADJUSTMENT     Center Frequency Click and drag the resonant filter nodes LEFT or RIGHT to adjust the center frequency.   Slope Click and drag the resonant filter node handles towards or away from the node to adjust the center frequency.     Gain Reduction Trace Draws a line on a waveform display and a scrolling trace to represent the gain reduction applied to the selected band over time. Use this view to monitor and set the response times (attack and release) and gain reduction envelope applied over time.\n Gain Reduction Trace in Dynamics Module\nWhen using the Dynamics module in the multiband mode, the gain reduction trace displays the waveform and amount of gain reduction applied to the currently selected band only. The trace color will reflect the color of the band currently selected.\n  Post Filter Displays harmonic highlights that represent the saturation being applied to your signal across the frequency spectrum. You can adjust a high-shelf filter that affects the wet (processed) output of the module to tame any high frequency content that may have been introduced by the module\u0026rsquo;s processing.\n Post Filter Color Indications\n The affected frequencies on the spectrum are indicated by a bright white fill. Non-affected frequencies on the spectrum will not display a fill color \n Post Filter in Exciter Module\nThe histogram display is calculated AFTER the Post Filter is applied. Adjusting the Post Filter will update the histogram display to show the saturation occurring at the output of the Exciter module.\n  Spectrum Analyzer Displays the real-time spectrum of the module\u0026rsquo;s output.\n  Stereo Width Spectrum Enable to view a hybrid mirrored spectrum display of the signal’s stereo width.\n ",

            "text": "Overview Ozone 9’s standalone application allows you to use its mastering tools outside of your DAW. Differing from the Ozone mothership plug-in, this standalone application includes a transport, file import/export, basic track editing, and the iZotope plug-in module option in the signal chain.\n Application Interface The key areas of the Ozone application interface are outlined in the image and table below.\n    LABEL SECTION      File Menu    Application Header    Track Workspace    Signal Chain and Module Interface     File Menu Ozone’s file menu contains the different commands used to perform functions as described in the table below.\n   FILE OPTION DESCRIPTION     Create New Project Creates a new Ozone project directory.   Open Project Opens a previously saved Ozone project.   Open Recent Project Displays a list of any recent projects. If you want to clear this recent project list, click Clear List.   Save Saves current project.   Save Project As.. Creates a copy of the current project directory with a new name.   Save (.OZN) As.. Saves a new copy of the session file within the current Ozone project directory. This is useful for versioning your Ozone projects over time. This saving method will NOT create copies of the imported audio files. Instead it will reference the files included in the Imported Audio Files folder of the current project directory.   Import Audio Files Opens your file system manager and allows you to choose an audio file to import. See Importing Audio section for more information.   Export Audio Files Opens the file manager and allows you to export an audio file to your computer. See Exporting Audio section for more information.   Close Project Closes out of your current project. A dialog window will appear asking if you wish to proceed with/without saving your current project.    Saving Ozone Projects\nAn Ozone project contains the following components:\n An Ozone session file (.OZN). An Imported Audio Files folder. An Exported Audio Files folder.  An Ozone session file (.OZN) contains all of the session data:\n Imported audio tracks Ozone module settings Track Trim \u0026amp; Fade settings Global I/O settings   Importing Audio You can import up to 16 audio files into an Ozone project using the following methods seen in the image and table below.\n    LABEL IMPORT METHOD      Click on the File menu. Choose “Import Audio Files” from the File Menu options.    Use keyboard shortcut Cmd+I or Ctrl+I; A standard dialog box will appear where you can navigate to the desired file, then click “Open” to import it into the project.    Click on the + icon in the track navigation area    Drag and drop audio files into the Ozone interface.    No Duplicate Audio Files\nOzone only allows you to import the same audio file once per project.\n Supported Import File Types    FILE FORMATS BIT DEPTH(S) SAMPLE RATE(S)     .wav 16-bit 11,250 Hz   .aiff 20-bit 22,050 Hz   .mp3 24-bit 44,100 Hz   .aac  48,000 Hz     88,200 Hz     96,000 Hz     176,400 Hz     192,000 Hz    Sample Rates\n A projects sample rate defaults to the sample rate of the first file loaded. If you attempt to load a file with a different sample rate, it will be converted to the original sample rate set by the first file, or manually set before the second file is loaded. The conversion process will not convert previously converted/processed files (which are copied as working files upon load); Ozone will simply go back to the original files, create new copies, and then convert all the files to this new sample rate for their new working copies. \n Exporting Audio You can export processed audio files from the Ozone application using the following methods outlined in the table below.\n   EXPORT METHOD DESCRIPTION     File Menu Method Click on the File menu. Choose “Export Audio Files” from the File Menu options.   Exporting Audio Track Navigaion Use the keyboard shortcut Command+E (Mac) or Ctrl+E (Windows).    Exporting Audio Options A dialog box will appear, offering various options for the files you are about to export as outlined in the table and images below.\n Current Track vs. All Tracks There are two tabs in the Exporting Audio Options window:\n Current Track: Used to export the audio file in the currently highlighted tab. All Tracks: Used to export separate audio files for each audio file loaded into the current project.     OPTION DESCRIPTION CURRENT TRACK ALL TRACKS     Filename Type the desired name into this field to label your exported file. X    Append Text Type in the desired text to append each track being exported. You can select to append either before or after the file name which is useful for “tagging” the titles of a group of audio files with a common label.  X   Add Track Numbers Select the “Add Track Numbers” checkbox to add track numbers to your exports in the order they appear in your Ozone project.  X   Format Select the format of the exported file(s): WAV, AIFF, MP3, or AAC. X X   Bit Rate Sets the bit rate for compressed file formats. Audio quality improves with increasing bit rate. (Available on MP3 and AAC Only). X X   Save Path Click on the Set Path button to open your File System window and to select where your exported audio file(s) will be saved. X X   Sample Rate Sets the sample rate to export your audio file as. If you select a sample rate that differs from the original imported file, Ozone will apply a high-quality sample rate conversion to the file. X X   Bit Depth Sets a Bit Depth value for your audio file. X X   Enable Dither Check this box to apply high-quality dithering to the exported file, typically used when exporting to a bit depth lower than 32-bit. For more information, see Enable Dither section below. X X   Prevent Clipping Check this box to prevent clipping through either the Normalize or Limit option. X X   Export Click this button to begin the export process (or launch the Track Info screen for MP3 and AAC). A dialog box will appear that shows the progress of the export operation, which occurs faster than real time. X X   Track Info Opens the Track Info window after clicking Export.

(Available for MP3 and AAC Only) X X    AAC \u0026amp; MP3 Codecs used by Ozone\nFor AAC, Ozone uses Fraunhofer’s codec. For MP3 the LAME codec is used (www.mp3dev.org). If an MP3 or AAC format is selected, files are exported with a 44.1kHz sampling rate.\n SAVE PATH OPTIONS\n If the project is unsaved, the default save path is your Documents folder. If the project has already been saved, the default save path is an Exported Audio Files folder in the same location as the project. \n Enable Dither Allows you to preserve the sound quality and dynamic range of a higher bit depth, when exporting the audio file to a lower bit depth. Ozone processes files at 32-bit so dither is desirable for files being exported to values lower than 32-bit.\n For example, a common workflow is to record audio at 24-bit resolution, then import and process the audio in an application such as Ozone, which will process at a higher resolution (32-bit). If you are releasing the audio material on a commercial CD, it must be converted to 16-bit audio, the required bit depth of the “Red Book” CD audio format.   Application Header Most of the controls and features in the Ozone mothership plug-in are also available in the Ozone Application. Transport controls and readouts are unique to the Ozone Application since it is an audio workspace and not a plugin.\n    LABEL SECTION      Master Assistant    Preset System    Transport Controls    Undo    Undo History    Options    Help    Transport Controls Ozone provides Transport controls at the top of the interface, which allow you to easily navigate the playback functions of an imported audio file.

Click on the color bar to set a loop selection for that segment.     Signal Chain And Module Interface The signal chain and included modules are the same across the Ozone 9 Application and Ozone 9 mothership plug-in. However, the Ozone 9 Application includes an extra module called the Plug-in module.\n Please see the General Controls chapter for more information on the Signal Chain. Navigate through the rest of the Help documentation for more information on the modules included in Ozone 9. See the Plug-in module section below for more information on how to utilize this module.  Plug-in Module The Plug-in Module is special to the Ozone Application. The following workflow details how to access and use the Plug-in module:\n Add the Plug-in module to choose an iZotope plug-in to add to your signal chain. Once added to the signal chain, the module card will appear with the plug-in\u0026rsquo;s name in the signal chain. The Plug-in module card has the same basic Signal Chain controls as the Ozone application modules, but does not include a preset option. When you click on the plug-in module, the Ozone application will open the plug-in in a new window, allowing you to begin use.   Plug-in Module Options Click on the Options icon to open the Options window to the Plug-in tab.

            "text": "Overview Master Assistant is designed to give you a starting point that is intelligently tailored to your music to help you create a professional-sounding master, regardless of your experience level.\nAccessing Master Assistant In the Ozone 9 mothership, you can access Master Assistant by clicking on the Master Assistant button.\n Genre Classes Master Assistant uses target genre curves generated from spectral analysis of different genres to analyze and classify your input audio. The genre classification will determine which preset is applied to your audio. See the Processing Steps section below for more information on how these curves are used during Master Assistant processing. Your audio will be designated into the following representative categories: Classical, Country, EDM, Folk, Hip-hop/Rap, Jazz, Pop, RnB/Soul, World, Rock\nThese presets provide starting points for the modules used in Master Assistant, and will set parameters that are not learned from your input audio, such as: IRC Mode in the Maximizer and Attack times in Dynamics. The Master Assistant presets are more subtle than those used in Neutron\u0026rsquo;s Track Assistant.\nGenerating Unique Target Curves\n Master Assistant will analyze your audio to determine how similar it is to the genre curves. Master Assistant will assign a percentage of similarity to each genre class curve and create a unique target curve based on these percentages. For example: Your track is classified with the following percentages: 60% Pop, 30% Rock, and 10% Country. The resulting unique target curve will be a mix of 60% of the Pop target, 30% of the Rock target and 10% of the Country target. \n Target curve is based on Reference audio\n When \u0026ldquo;Reference\u0026rdquo; is chosen as the Master Assistant Target, the unique target curve is derived from the selected Reference track and not by calculating the genre classes of your input audio. \n Recommended Workflow  Click on the Master Assistant button to adjust the Master Assistant settings. Choose from the Master Assistant settings outlined in the Master Assistant Settings section below. Click Next when you are ready to play your audio for Master Assistant. Play back your audio for at least 30 seconds so that Master Assistant can analyze the audio content.  For best results, we recommend running Master Assistant on the loudest portion of the track. To analyze a section that is less than 30 seconds long, we recommend looping playback prior to running Master Assistant.   When Master Assistant is finished, you can either Accept or Cancel the changes.  Accept will exit the Master Assistant settings window and retain all settings Master Assistant modified. Cancel will dismiss the Master Assistant panel and revert your settings to the state they were in prior to running Master Assistant. Undo any accepted Master Assistant changes using Undo History.     What Are You Going For Settings Adjusting the Master Assistant settings gives a baseline for Master Assistant to help you find a starting point relative to your artistic vision.\n Modules Choose from either Modern or Vintage to determine the type of style of module processing you want to apply to your audio. You can choose from the following settings as described in the table below.\n   Setting Description     Modern Select to apply standard (non-vintage) module settings to achieve targets.   Vintage Select to apply vintage module settings to achieve targets.    Loudness You can either manually set how intense (how loud) you want the assistant to aim for or you can use a reference to match the intensity of that track.\n   Setting Description     Manual Select to manually set your loudness intentstiy target which will adjust the Maximizer Threshold to reach your recommended loudness target. Master Assistant will listen to your audio and load a preset that is based on the genre class detected with the highest percentage of similarity.   Reference Select to choose any reference track that is currently loaded in the Reference panel as your target or by importing a Reference. The target loudness and target EQ curves will be calculated from the loudness and EQ curve of the selected reference track. See the Load Reference Track setting in the image below.     Intensity Choose the amount of target loudness processing applied to your audio ranging from:\n low (-14 LUFS) medium (-12 LUFS) high(-11 LUFS)  Destination Sets the Maximizer ceiling to provide your audio with an appropriate amount of headroom based on your destination medium.\n   SETTING Maximizer CEILING TARGET     Streaming -1 dB   CD -.3 dB    Next Click to play a part of your track so that Master Assistant can detect which settings to implement for setting up your workspace.\n Master Assistant Processing Master Assistant will process the audio based on the information gained from your selected settings and the incoming audio. Master Assistant will process this information in the following order:\n Master Assistant will listen to the incoming audio.   If Master Assistant is not receiving audio, you will see a “Waiting for audio” screen will appear. To dismiss the Waiting screen, simply playback audio.  Master Assistant classifies the processing based on Modern or Vintage. Master Assistant will calculate and implement loudness parameters. Master Assistant will set the Maximizer threshold ceiling based on your destination setting. Master Assistant will modify the settings in specific modules based on the genre detected.   End Result: A unique mastering signal chain that acts as an ideal starting point.  Play Loudest Portion of Your Track\nIt is important to play the loudest portion of your track when running Master Assistant. Learning the Maximizer Threshold on a quiet portion will maximize the loudness for that portion of the track. This can potentially introduce distortion in louder sections of the track since the Threshold was learned for lower level signals.\n Module Settings Adjustments Master Assistant provides suggestions or starting points for the modules in the signal chain and their settings. These are simply a way to help reduce time in your workflow. However, we encourage you to add, remove, and adjust the modules to suit your mastering needs.\nModern Mode When you use Modern Mode, Master Assistant will adjust the following modules.\n   Module Master Assistant Adjustments     EQ Determines the EQ settings by comparing the input audio to the unique target curve generated. EQ nodes are adjusted to closely match your incoming audio to the unique target curve.   Dynamics Measures the Crest Factor of your incoming audio to determine if applying Dynamics processing will positively affect the output of the Maximizer. Learns the average level of your input audio to set the Compressor Threshold values.   Maximizer Determines the Ceiling value and Threshold value  based on the Target setting. Compares the input and output signals of the Maximizer to determine which frequencies are hitting the Limiter the hardest. For more information on the specifics impact of each Target setting on the Maximizer see Maximizer Settings section below.   Dynamic EQ Sets Dynamic EQ nodes at peak frequencies found in the Maximizer to reduce potential distortion. Learns Threshold values based on the input audio to the Dynamic EQ bands.    Vintage Mode When you use Vintage Mode, Master Assistant will adjust the following modules.\n   Module Master Assistant Adjustments     Equalizer Determines the Equalizer settings by comparing the input audio to the unique target curve generated. Equalizer nodes are adjusted to closely match your incoming audio to the unique target curve.   Vintage EQ Adjusts the Vintage EQ settings of low boost and high cut to achieve a warmer tonal characteristic depending on the input audio.   Vintage Compressor Analyzes the dynamic range of the input audio. If no extreme dynamic range is detected, then the Vintage Compressor is bypassed. Otherwise, Master Assistant engages Vintage Compressor to smooth out the dynamic range of the signal.   Vintage Limiter Adjusts the Vintage Limiter threshold and ceiling simultaneously by linking the threshold and ceiling controls in order to add an analog character to your input signal while maintaining the same gain.   Maximizer Determines the Ceiling value and Threshold value based on the Target setting. For more information on the specifics impact of each Target setting on the Maximizer see Maximizer Settings section below.    EFFECTS TO THE SIGNAL CHAIN\nThe modules included and their order in the signal chain will always be the same after running Master Assistant. Depending on your input audio, Master Assistant may bypass the Dynamics module.\n EQ BAND SETTINGS\nMaster Assistant will always enable Low Shelf \u0026amp; High Shelf filters on Bands 1 \u0026amp; 8 (respectively). Master Assistant will add up to 6 Peak Bell filters in Bands 2-7 in order to match the target curve.\n DYNAMICS MODULE AND CREST FACTOR\nApplying some light low-end compression to overly dynamic audio will allow the Maximizer to operate more transparently.\n If the detected genre class falls under the broad \u0026ldquo;Orchestral\u0026rdquo; category, crest factor will be calculated based on the full bandwidth of your signal. Otherwise, Crest Factor will be calculated for the low band of your input audio. If the Crest Factor measurement is higher than a predetermined cutoff value (this cutoff was determined as a result of our internal research) we will enable the Dynamics module. If the Crest Factor measurement falls under our predetermined cutoff value, the Dynamics module will be disabled. The total Crest Factor range used by Master Assistant is -1 to 14 and the “ideal” Crest Factor range is 3 to 10. If the Crest Factor measurement is lower than 3, it can be considered “too compressed.” If the Crest Factor measurement is higher than 10, it can be considered “too dynamic.” \n Higher Track Level Than Target Loudness\n If your track is louder than the Target Loudness value, Master Assistant will not make it any quieter than the difference introduced by the Ceiling value. \n  Accept/Cancel When Master Assistant has finished, you can either Accept or Cancel the changes.\n Accept will retain all settings modified by Master Assistant. If you Accept changes and decide to revert them, you can undo the Master Assistant changes in the Undo History window. Cancel will dismiss the Master Assistant panel and revert your settings to the state they were in prior to running Master Assistant.   ",

            "text": "Overview The Dynamics module can be used to shape the dynamics of your master, with up to four bands of analog-modeled compression, limiting, and expansion.\n Module Interface Ozone 9\u0026rsquo;s Dynamics module main interface components are outlined in the image and table below.\n    LABEL SECTION      Module Header    Meters \u0026amp; Displays    Controls     Module Header The Dynamics module header includes the following global module controls and features outlined in the image and table below.\n    LABEL SECTION      Views Selector    Channel Processing Modes    Learn    Reset    Views The Dynamics module includes the following view options to show in the Views display:\n Crossover Gain Reduction Detection Filter  Channel Processing Modes The Dynamics module can operate in either Stereo or Mid/Side operation. See the Mid/Side Processing section for more details.\nMULTIBAND COMPRESSION AND MID/SIDE PROCESSING\nWhen dealing with multiband compression on a stereo mix, it is sometimes difficult to apply processing to a specific instrument or vocal if they are too close in frequency.\nIn these cases, Mid/Side processing reveals more refined control by allowing you to separate a specific frequency range into its Mid and Side components and apply compression separately to the Mid (center) channel, or the Sides of your mix.\nThere are many uses for Mid/Side processing while using compression. For example, this can help prevent other instruments from being affected by compression made to the lead vocal. This is especially true since the vocal typically sits in the center of your mix while the other instruments are usually found at the sides.\n Learn Enables the Dynamics module Crossover Spectrum View to search for natural crossover cutoff points for multiband processing.\nLEARN ONLY APPLIES TO CROSSOVER VIEW\nThe Learn button does not change other View settings within the Dynamics module except for the Crossover Spectrum View.\n PLAY AUDIO FOR LEARN TO ENGAGE\nIn order for Learn to function as expeced, the module must be receiving audio input while Learn is engaged.\n LEARN WILL DISABLE WHEN DONE\nAfter Learn determines and sets the ideal values for the crossover cutoffs, it will turn itself off automatically. When the Learn button is toggled OFF the button is grey instead of orange. You can also manually disable Learn when it is active by clicking the Learn button again.\n Reset Returns all controls in the Dynamics module back to their factory default values. You can use the Undo History window to revert any settings used before clicking Reset.\n Controls There are three categories of controls you can adjust in the Dynamics control panel:\n Limiter \u0026amp; Compressor Controls Dynamic Curve Contols Output Controls   Limiter and Compressor Controls The Limiter and Compressor utilize the following controls:\n Threshold Ratio Attack Release  Compressing and Limiting in Dynamics Signal Flow\nIn the Dynamics module, the Compressor processing preceeds the Limiter processing in the signal flow. By applying the Compressor and Limiter in this way, you are free to create complex transfer curves.\n Threshold The Threshold has the following associated controls:\n Threshold Meter Level Detection Modes  There are two types of thresholds you can adjust:\n Compressor Threshold Limiter Threshold  Adjusting either threshold will determine the signal level at which the compressor or limiter begins dynamics processing.\nADJUSTING THRESHOLD\n Click and drag the Threshold slider handle up to increase the Threshold or down to decrease the Threshold. Click on the Threshold value readout text and manually enter a value in the inline edit field.  Threshold Meter The Threshold meter displays the input level into the detection circuit (displayed in grey) alongside the gain reduction occurring as a result of the dynamics processing (displayed in the corresponding band color).\n The two meters on the far left and right of the threshold meter display the input audio level. The two meters in between the input meters display the gain reduction applied.  Level Detection Modes Select one of the three modes outlined in the table below to determine the type of calculation you want applied to your signal processing within the Dynamics module.\n   MODE EFFECT     Peak When this option is enabled Ozone’s detection circuit looks at the peak levels of the incoming signal. In general, this setting is useful when you are trying to even out sudden peaks in your music.   Env Envelope mode behaves much like RMS mode, but with some key advantages. Unlike RMS, Envelope mode produces even levels across all frequencies. Additionally, Envelope mode will not produce the aliasing or artifacts that RMS detection can cause.   RMS When this option is enabled, Ozone looks at the average level of the incoming signal. RMS detection is useful when you are trying to increase the overall volume level without changing the character of the sound.    Ratio Determines how much gain reduction will be applied to the entire signal or band when the threshold is crossed, according to the rules set by the Level Detection Mode. Both the Limiter and Compressor have their own ratio control.\n Higher positive ratios: result in more extreme compression. Lower negative ratios: result in an expander effect.  Limiter Maximum Ratio\nThe limiter in the Dynamics module is similar to the function of a limiter in the analog domain. This characteristic allows some overshoot when setting the Ratio to the maximum 30:1 meaning that this is not a Brickwall limiter.\n Attack Determines the amount of time, or how quickly it takes (in milliseconds), for the dynamics to react and for the signal to become fully compressed after exceeding the threshold level.\nRelease Adjusts the amount of time (milliseconds) it takes for the dynamics processor to return to unity gain (recovers gain) when the input signal falls below the threshold, according to the rules set by the Level Detection Mode.\nDynamic Curve Controls The Dynamic Curve controls appear in the Dynamic Curve Meter view. These controls are individual nodes for the Limiter (L) and Compressor ( C ). These nodes are linked to the Threshold and Ratio controls, and can be used to adjust the curve visually, rather than using the standard controls. These controls are outlined in the image and table below.\n    LABEL CONTROL      Knee    Slope    Dynamic Curve Meter Zoom    Dynamic Curve Meter Displays the input signal (x axis) plotted against the output (processed) signal (y axis). Lowering the horizontal compression control adds more compression to the signal.\nDynamic Curve Meter Zoom\nClick the + and - buttons in the bottom right when hovering the mouse over the Dynamics Curve Meter view to zoom in and out on the meter.\nSlope Adjust to set the slope of the Dynamic curve between the origin value and the knee value.\nDYNAMIC CURVE SLOPE IS THE RATIO\nWatch the Ratio slider while you make changes to the Dynamic Curve. The slope of the Dynamic Curve represents the ratio of the applied compressor and limiter processing. When you adjust the Knee and Slope nodes, you are effectively adjusting the Ratio value.\n Knee Adjust to set the desired character of the compression. There are two types of Knee nodes you can adjust in the Dynamic Curve view:\n Limiter Knee Compressor Knee  The range of knee values provide different results:\n Higher knee values result in a \u0026ldquo;soft knee\u0026rdquo; setting with a subtle, natural sounding compression. Lower knee values result in a \u0026ldquo;hard knee\u0026rdquo; setting with an aggressive compression often used as an intended effect on individual tracks such as kick and snare drum.  Output Controls The following output controls affect the overall signal output of the Dynamics module:\n Parallel Bands Display Link Bands Gain Auto Release Auto Gain  Parallel Adjust to set the amount of the dry, unprocessed (lightly compressed) signal to mix with the wet, processed (heavily compressed) signal. This technique is also known as \u0026ldquo;parallel compression\u0026rdquo;.\n At 100%, you will hear only the processed audio signal. At 50%, you will hear a blend between unprocessed and processed audio. At 0%, you will hear a only the unprocessed audio signal.  Bands Display Enable to toggle from Single Band view to an All Bands view. In the Single Band view, you can use the arrows left or right of the band icon to cycle through the enabled bands.\n Link Bands Enable to link all Limiter and Compressor Controls controls for each band. Adjusting any of these controls for one band while in linked mode will adjust all other Limiter and Compressor Controls for the other three bands by the same amount and vice versa.\nGain The resulting effect of the gain slider is dependent on the type of View you choose to work in.\n   VIEW TYPE GAIN SLIDER EFFECT     ALL BANDS The Gain slider affects the gain of the entire Dynamics module after processing. This is useful for compensating any loss in level after compression has been applied.   SINGLE BAND The Gain slider will affect the output gain of the currently selected band after processing.    Auto Gain Enabling allows the Dynamics module to automatically calculate and apply the make-up gain to the output signal. The make-up gain applied compensates for level differences introduced by dynamics processing.\nAuto \u0026amp; Manual Gain Adjustments\nAuto Gain calculates the RMS levels of the input and output signals independently for each Dynamics crossover band. Gain is automatically applied to the output signal based on the RMS level difference between the input and output signals. Auto Gain adapts the post-processing level to match the pre-processing input level over time. You can use this tool for A/B’ing various settings in the multiband Dynamics module without having gain changes affect your perception. Auto mode and manual band/global gain adjustments can be applied simultaneously.\n Adaptive Release Enable to allow the Dynamics module to automatically adjust the Release time of the Compressor based on the Peak factor of a signal.\n If a transient signal is detected, the Release time is scaled to be shorter for less pumping. If a sustained note is detected, the Release time is scaled to be longer for lower distortion.  Auto Release Adjustments\nThe Release time is scaled in relation to the Release value set by the user. For example: if you are using the Compressor with the Release time set to 100 ms, the Release time will be automatically adjusted to a value within a range of 20 ms to 200 ms, depending on the type of signal that is being processed.\n ",

Transparent way of addressing extreme lows and extreme highs for a more natural, gentle sounding effect.   Band shelf   Bell filter with wide, flat top. To change the relation between the harmonics in your audio. Useful for boosting or attenuating a block of frequencies.   Peak Bell   Smoothly boosts or cuts an adjustable region around a specific frequency. Looks like a bell, come on what do you want from me. Changes the overall color or texture of the sound with larger gain adjustments (boost or cut). This will be a more noticeable change than Proportional Q.   Proportional Q\n  Unique filter that varies shape in proportion to the amount of boost or cut applied. As you increase or decrease the gain, the change is proportional to bandwidth. Tight, precise corrective cuts-the bigger gain adjustment, the tighter the cut will become.    Readouts Use the HUD Readouts to see and adjust where the node is located within the Dynamic EQ module. The table below describes the readouts available with each readout\u0026rsquo;s respective units.\n   Readout Units Description     Frequency Hz Shows the center frequency (or cutoff frequency) of the currently selected node. The Dynamic EQ module supports frequency values ranging from 20 Hz to 20 kHz.   Gain dB Shows the amount of gain applied by the selected filter. The Dynamic EQ module supports gain adjustments ranging from -30 dB to +15 dB.   Q (cF/Bandwidth) (Parametric/Bell Filters) Shows the width or slope of the selected filter.    Adjust Frequency, Gain, and Q There are 3 ways to adjust the Frequency, Gain, and Q:\n Click and drag band node or handles (for Q only). Manually enter the value. Use arrow keys.  The three types of adjustments you can apply for altering the Frequency, Gain, and Q values are outlined in the table below.\n   VALUE TYPES OF ADJUSTMENTS     Frequency Click and drag the band node left to decrease the frequency or right to increase the frequency.

You can also adjust the width of all four bands.\n Positive values: Widens the output of the band Negative Values: narrows the output of the band Setting of -100: effectively mono  Adjusting the Band Width Sliders\nYou can set the value of each Band Width slider in two ways:\n Click and drag the slider UP or DOWN. Double-click on the slider readout value and enter the desired value in the text field. \n Stereoize Enable to activate the Stereoize Amount slider.\nStereoize Amount Adjust the slider to add natural-sounding stereo width to narrow recordings and to control the character of the stereo effect in conjunction with the width sliders.\nStereoize Effect is Mono Compatible\nThe Stereoize effect is completely mono compatible. Even if you add width to audio, it can still be played back in mono without producing unpleasant artifacts.\n Stereoize Modes The following Stereoize Modes become available when amount is enabled:\n   MODE EFFECT     Mode I A classic stereoize mode that has been used since Imager\u0026rsquo;s introduction in Ozone 5. This applies a time-based effect that will add additional width to your signal.   Mode II A newly developed alternative to the classic stereoize mode. This new mode has a slightly different tonal quality from the original and helps to preserve transients at higher settings.    Link Bands Enable to link Band Width controls across all bands. When a Band Width control is adjusted for one band, the other three Band Width controls will be adjusted by the same amount.\nVectorscope The Vectorscope provides a view of the stereo image of the signal and monitors Ozone’s final output, regardless of the Imager’s place in the signal chain. You can check mixes for stereo separation, while using the module’s controls to provide more or less separation. The vectorscope provides three different views as outlined in the image and table below, a Correlation Meter, and Clipping indicator.\n    VECTORSCOPE TYPE PLOT DISPLAY READING THE PLOT     Polar Sample Plots dots per sample on a polar coordinate display to highlight the stereo image of the incoming signal. Patterns that appear within the 45-degree safe lines represent in-phase audio. Patterns outside these lines represent out-of-phase audio.   Polar Level Plots rays on a polar coordinate display that represent sample averages and displays the stereo energy of a recording. The length of the rays represents amplitude. The angle of the rays represents their position in the stereo image. Rays within the 45-degree safe lines represent in-phase audio. Rays beyond the safe lines represents out-of-phase audio.   Lissajous Plots per-sample dots on a traditional oscilloscope display similar to the Polar Sample vectorscope. Typically, stereo recordings produce a random pattern on a Lissajous Vectorscope that is taller than it is wide. Vertical patterns mean left and right channels are similar (approaching mono). Horizontal patterns mean the two channels are very different, which could result in mono compatibility problems.    Polar Sample Veterscope History Fade\nThe history of the Polar Sample Vectorscope also fades out slowly. You can reset the display by clicking on the meter.\n Polar Level Veterscope History Shrink\nHistory is represented on the Polar Level Vectorscope with the shrinking of the plotted rays slowly over time. The rays shrink towards the center of the vectorscope leaving the outer portion of the display for real-time analysis.\n Correlation Meter Indicates the degree of similarity (or correlation) between the left and right channels, displayed in a +1/0/-1 vertical meter.\nReading the Correlation Meter\nThe Correlation meter can display a few different cases:\n Common Case: When the audio in the LEFT and RIGHT channels are similar, the meter draws towards the top.  Extreme Case: When the LEFT and RIGHT channels are exactly the same, the correlation is +1 and the meter would be positioned all the way at the top.   Common Case: When the LEFT and RIGHT channels are different, the meter draws towards the bottom. Extreme Case: When the LEFT and RIGHT channels are exactly out of phase, the correlation is -1 and the meter would be positioned all the way at the bottom. \n Clipping The Vectorscope will draw any clipped samples in red. To clear the meter display, simply double-click on the Vectorscope.\nPhase Correlation Meter\n In general, most recordings have phase correlations in the 0 to +1 range. A brief readout towards the bottom half of the meter is not necessarily a problem but could represent a possible mono compatibility issue. As you apply greater multiband stereo widening to your audio, the phase correlation will tend to draw more towards the bottom half of the meter, as the left and right channels will become “wider” and less similar. \n ",

Match Curve Setting Recommendations\n A Matched Curve amount of 100% and a Smoothing amount of 0% might be technically the closest match to your “Reference” mix, but in reality it’s probably not the most effective combination of the settings. Those settings will try to capture every peak, valley, and level, which can result in extreme, unnatural EQs. We suggest working with the Matched Curve amount under 50%. If your Matching EQ curve has narrow peaks and valleys, increase the Smoothing parameter to smooth them out. Your goal is to capture the overall tonal shape of the Reference as opposed to an exact match. \n Ozone App and Target Curves All tracks share a common target curve in the Ozone application.\n PINK NOISE AND 6DB AS REFERENCE GUIDES You can implement Pink Noise and 6 db as presets within Match EQ as references to compare your audio with these presets to find spectral anomalies. You can use it as a representative slope for your spectrum. It is the slope of the spectrum (as opposed to the absolute level of the mix) that defines the tonal balance.\n Customize your References Use Match EQ to customize your references by saving targets similar to saving presets in Tonal Balance Control 2.\n ",

The Maximizer applies to the entire bandwidth of the mix; it is not a multiband effect.\n Module Interface Ozone 9\u0026rsquo;s Maximizer module controls and features are outlined in the table below.\n    LABEL SECTION      Module Header    Meters \u0026amp; Displays    Controls     Module Header     LABEL SECTION      Views Selector    Reset    View Selector The Maximizer module includes the following views:\n Gain Reduction Detection Filter  Reset Returns all controls in the Maximizer module to their factory default values.\nUNDO HISTORY TO REVERT SETTINGS\nIf you wish to return to settings you were using before clicking the Reset button, you can use the Undo History window to revert the settings.\n  Controls The Maximizer includes the following controls in the control panel:\n IRC Modes Learn Threshold Threshold Stereo Independence Transient Emphasis   IRC Modes The Maximizer includes the following Intelligent Release Control (IRC) modes outlined in the table below.\n   MODE EFFECT CPU PERFORMANCE     IRC LL Provides the intelligent digital loudness maximization of IRC I with lower latency. Lowest latency AND least CPU intensive.   IRC I Provides intelligent digital loudness maximization of the signal. It does this by analyzing the source material and applying limiting in a psychoacoustically pleasing manner, reacting quickly to transients (to prevent pumping) and reacting more slowly to steady bass tones (to prevent distortion). Not too intensive on CPU performance.   IRC II Similar to IRC I, but optimized to preserve transients even more, so they sound sharper and clearer in the output signal, even when aggressive limiting is taking place. Moderately CPU intensive.   IRC III Allows for the most aggressive limiting by using an advanced psychoacoustic model to intelligently determine the speed of limiting that can be done to the incoming signal, before producing distortion that is detectable to the human ear. When set to this mode an option to choose between four different character styles, will become available to you. These styles will help you manage the limiter’s sound by constraining its release behavior. Very CPU-intensive, and produces high latency, especially at higher sampling rates. You may find that at sampling rates greater than 48kHz you are unable to use IRC III mode in real-time.   IRC IV This mode builds upon our existing IRC technology and by shaping the spectrum to further reduce pumping and distortion. As the signal goes farther over the threshold, the IRC IV algorithm limits frequency bands that contribute most to these peaks. This reduces intermodulation between different signal components and uses dozens of psychoacoustically spaced bands in order to react to any type of audio. When no limiting is necessary, the spectrum will be unaltered. When set to this mode an optoin to choose between three different character styles, will become available to you. These styles will help you manage the limiter’s sound by constraining its release behavior. Most CPU-intensive, and produces high latency, especially at higher sampling rates.    IRC III Character Styles    STYLE EFFECT     Clipping The most aggressive style setting of IRC III and will slightly colorize your mix with distortion or achieve the highest degree of loudness with the greatest risk of clipping.   Crisp Agressively constrains the limiter’s release behavior and will favor distortion over any pumping.   Balanced Constrains the release behavior of the limiter in a generally transparent way and should be suitable for most material.   Pumping The least aggressive style setting for IRC III and does not constrain the limiter’s release behavior. It can tend toward a slower release behavior and may result in pumping. This is the “legacy” setting and is the behavior used in Ozone version 5.01 and earlier.    IRC IV Character Styles    STYLE EFFECT     Classic Provides general enhancement of the overall mix with a sound more reminiscent of Ozone’s earlier limiting algorithms which are still being used by professionals today.   Modern Provides general enhancement and life to your mix but with greater detail and clarity than the Classic style.   Transient Optimized for maximum preservation of all transients resulting in a highly detailed overall sound that may benefit some mixes needing added clarity.    Learn Threshold Enable to allow the Maximizer to adjust the Threshold slider in response to your input audio so that it meets the pre-defined Threshold Target value.\n Double-click the Target LUFS value readout to edit the Lufts Target Value.  Learn Threshold Dynamically Updates\nThe Learn Threshold control will not disable itself after learning. It can be used to continuously update the Threshold to meet the Target value.\n Learn Threshold Not Recommended for Loudness Compliance\nThe Learn Threshold control is not intended to be used to meet loudness compliance standards.\n Threshold Adjust the threshold of the Maximizer to set the level at which the limiting processing takes place and determines the amount of gain added to maximize the output level. The threshold control includes the following sub-controls and meter:\n Threshold Meter Ceiling Link True Peak  Threshold Triggering and Maximizer Output\nSetting the Threshold to a non-zero value that doesn\u0026rsquo;t trigger the limiter will still increase the output of the Maximizer. For example if the input level to the Maximizer is peaking at -15 dB and the Maximizer Threshold is set to -4dB, limiting will not occur, but the level at the output of the Maximizer will be peaking at -11dB.\n Threshold Meter Displays the input level to the module alongside the gain reduction applied by the module\u0026rsquo;s processing.\n  The two meters on the far left and right of the threshold meter display the input audio level. The two meters that appear in between the input meters display the gain reduction applied.  Ceiling Adjust to set the maximum output level of the Maximizer.\nCeiling, Dither, and Codec Preview\nIt is generally recommended to use a setting of -0.3 dB when dithering, or a more dramatic setting (-0.6 dB to -0.8 dB) when mastering audio to be converted to .mp3 or .aac later, in order to prevent clipping in the future. See the Codec Preview section for more details.\n Threshold \u0026amp; Ceiling Link Enable to link the Threshold and Ceiling controls. Adjusting either control in linked mode will adjust the other control by the same amount and vice versa.\nTrue Peak When enabled, the limiter will account for the levels of each digital sample and the levels of the analog signal that will eventually be produced by D/A conversion. Enables the limiter to take into account not only the levels of each digital sample but also the levels of the analog signal that will eventually be produced by D/A conversion. This is sometimes necessary, since an analog signal’s peak level can exceed the corresponding digital signal’s peak level by more than 3 dB.\nTrue Peak Limiting \u0026amp; CPU Usage\nThis option will result in a small increase in CPU usage, but if your mixes are running very hot you may want to enable it to ensure that absolutely no distortion is introduced when your audio is finally run through a D/A converter.\n Character Adjust to customize the overall response time (attack and release times) of the maximizer processing. The attack and release times used are dependent on the selected Mode, and allows a continuous range from Fast (0.0) to Slow (10.0) in each mode.\nStereo Independence The Stereo Independence controls represent the next iteration of the Stereo Unlink control in previous versions of Ozone. By default, the Stereo Independence controls (Transient and Sustain) will be linked and set to 0% - mimicking the default settings of the previous Stereo Unlink control.\n Transient Slider: Adjusts how the limiter responds to transient material across channels. Sustain Slider: Adjusts how the limiter responds to sustained material across channels. Link: Links the Transient and Sustain sliders.     SLIDER SETTING EFFECT     Both Sliders set to 100% It is possible to achieve a louder output from the Maximizer, but this can result in a narrow stereo image. To alleviate the narrowing effect of the Stereo Unlink control, we split this feature into two sliders.   Sliders independently set to non-zero values Applies limiting to transient and sustained material separately, based on a level envelope generated from a ratio of the individual channel levels and the entire stereo image.    Transient Emphasis Enable Transient Emphasis adjustment by clicking the Transient Emphasis power button.\n Adjusting the Amount control allows you to fine-tune the shaping of transients before limiting takes place. This can be useful for preserving sharper sounds, like drums, while still optimizing loudness.  Tranisent Emphasis Settings\nUsing higher amount values for Transient Emphasis will result in more pronounced transients after the limiting process.\n Input Level and Maximizer\nTry setting Ozone’s input level so that the input meter is peaking at the upper half to upper quarter of the meter. It is OK if the input meter peaks close to the top when the Maximizer module is enabled, since it will keep the audio from clipping.\n ",

Higher ratios will result in more compression.\nAttack \u0026amp; Release Adjust the attack and release controls to set how quickly the Vintage Compressor reacts to audio that crosses the threshold.\n ATTACK: Determines how quickly the Vintage Compressor reacts when the threshold is reached. RELEASE: Determines the amount of time before the Vintage Compressor returns the level. This control sets the release time for transients. For sustained compression, the release time will be significantly longer.  Qualities of Attack and Release\nThe Attack and Release express unique qualities in a the vintage compressor, such as:\n Release time on transients is much faster than it is on periods of sustained compression, which helps to decrease both pumping and distortion. Attack and release times can vary depending on how much compression is occurring. \n Gain Adjusts the output gain of the Vintage Compressor module to makeup for decreases in volume.\nAuto Gain When turned on, Auto Gain calculates the RMS levels of both the input and output signals of the Vintage Compressor in order to apply the appropriate gain to the output signal.\nAuto Gain as A/B Tool\nAuto Gain acts as a smart \u0026ldquo;make-up gain\u0026rdquo; control that adapts over time and adjusts your levels to a comparable level of your unprocessed audio. This can be a useful tool for A/B’ing various settings without having gain changes affect your perception.\n ",

This includes the following controls which are further described in the tables below:\n Low Frequency High Frequency Boost High Frequency Cut  The bottom row of parameters are modeled after the Pultec MEQ-5 Equalizer. This includes the following controls which are further described in the tables below:\n Mid Frequency Low-Mid Frequency High-Mid Frequency  Pultec EQP-1A A unique feature of the Pultec EQP-1A is the ability to simultaneously adjust the boost and cut parameters for the low frequency band. While the original manual warns “Do not attempt to boost and attenuate simultaneously,” these controls interact in a way that many engineers have found to be desirable. Rather than canceling each other out, combining these controls results in a boost in the low frequencies, followed by a dip at slightly higher frequencies. This unique filter shape is also available in the Ozone Equalizer module as “Vintage Low Shelf”.\nLow Frequency    CONTROL DESCRIPTION     LOW FREQUENCY Sets the low frequency to be boosted. Options include: 20 Hz, 30 Hz, 45 Hz, 60 Hz, and 100 Hz.   LOW BOOST Sets the amount of boost applied to the selected low frequency. This is a low shelf filter.   LOW CUT Sets the amount of attenuation applied to the selected low frequency. This is a low shelf filter.    Low Frequency Selection Note\n The 45 Hz option isn’t present in the original hardware unit, but we’ve added this frequency because we found it to be useful for mastering. \n High Frequency Boost    CONTROL DESCRIPTION     HIGH BOOST FREQUENCY Sets the high frequency to be boosted. Options include 3 kHz, 4 kHz, 5 kHz, 8 kHz, 10 kHz, 12 kHz, and 16 kHz.   HIGH BOOST Sets the amount of boost applied to the selected high frequency. This is a peaking filter.   HIGH Q Sets the bandwidth for high frequency boosting. The boost amount and bandwidth interact (i.e., the Q changes as you boost), as they do in the EQP-1A.    High Frequency Cut Controls    CONTROL DESCRIPTION     HIGH CUT FREQUENCY Sets the high frequency to be attenuated. Options include 5 kHz, 10 kHz, and 20kHz.   HIGH CUT Sets the amount of attenuation applied to the selected high frequency. This is a high shelf filter.    Pultec MEQ-5 Equalizer Controls All of the mid frequency controls are peaking filters. As in the original MEQ-5, the filter bandwidths are affected by the boost/cut amount.\nLow-Mid Frequency Controls    CONTROL DESCRIPTION     LOW-MID BOOST FREQUENCY Sets the low-mid frequency to be boosted. Options include 200 Hz, 300 Hz, 500 Hz, 700 Hz, and 1000 Hz.   LM BOOST FREQUENCY Sets the amount of boost applied to the selected low-mid frequency band.    Mid Frequency Cut Controls    CONTROL DESCRIPTION     MID CUT FREQUENCY Sets the mid frequency to be attenuated. Options include 200 Hz, 300 Hz, 500 Hz, 700 Hz, 1 kHz, 1.5 kHz, 2 kHz, 3 kHz, 4 kHz, 5 kHz, and 7 kHz.   MID CUT Sets the amount of attenuation applied to the selected mid frequency.    High-Mid Frequency Controls    CONTROL DESCRIPTION     HIGH-MID BOOST FREQUENCY Sets the high-mid frequency to be boosted. Options include 1.5 kHz, 2 kHz, 3 kHz, 4 kHz, and 5 kHz.

Brings out the low-end transients while still providing the smoothness that is characteristic of analog circuitry.   Tube A more balanced limiter with variable attack and release times. Provides smooth feedback limiting with a wider range of sonic characteristics that vary depending on your incoming signal. Despite its non-linearity, it still allows for modern precision in preventing any clipping or peaks.   Modern Blends thicker vintage characteristics and wide range of non-linearity with modern IRC limiting, variable release times, and transient reproduction.    Threshold Adjust the threshold to set the level at which limiting takes place. The threshold control includes the following sub-controls and meter:\n Threshold Meter Ceiling Link True Peak  Threshold Meter Displays the applied gain reduction on the module\u0026rsquo;s input level.\n The two meters on the far left and right of the threshold meter display the input audio level. The two meters that appear in between the input meters display the gain reduction applied.   Ceiling Adjust to see the maximum output level of the Vintage Limiter.\nRecommendation\nIt is generally recommended to use a setting of -0.3 dB when dithering, or a more dramatic setting (-0.6 dB to -0.8 dB) when converting to MP3 or AAC formats in order to prevent clipping during conversion. See the Codec Preview section for more details.\n Link Enable to link the Threshold and Ceiling controls. Adjusting either control in linked mode will adjust the other control by the same amount and vice versa.\nTrue Peak Enable to engage the limiter to include the levels of each digital sample and of the analog signal resultant from D/A conversion. This is useful in situations where your analog signal’s peak level exceeds the corresponding digital signal’s peak level by more than 3 dB.\nTrue Peak Limiting \u0026amp; CPU Usage\nTurning ON True Peak will result in a small increase in CPU usage. If your mixes are running hot, you may want to enable it to ensure that no distortion is introduced when your audio is finally run through a D/A converter.\n Character Adjusts the attack and release times of the Vintage Limiter.

Changing the speed changes the wavelength (wavelength=speed/frequency). For example, a 500Hz signal at 7.5 ips will experience distortion at the same level as a 1kHz signal at 15 ips and a 2kHz signal at 30 ips.     SPEED EFFECT     7.5 Adds warmth by emphasizing the signal\u0026rsquo;s low end.   15 Adds a distinct body and thickness to your track.   30 Adds a subtle, refined polish with higher-fidelity and lower-noise.    Input Drive Adjusts input gain before tape emulation. The harder you drive the input, the more compression and saturation will occur.\n   INPUT DRIVE EFFECT     HIGHER INPUT DRIVE LEVEL Can lead to more saturation in tape emulation.   LOWER INPUT DRIVE LEVEL Can reduce added saturation in tape emulation.    Saturation and Tape\nTape becomes non-linear when recording high amplitude signals, leading to saturation. The level necessary to achieve a certain amount of saturation depends on the frequency content of the source material and the bias setting.\n Bias Adjust to customize the shape of the distortion curve and high-frequency response of the tape emulation. Both negative and positive bias will add distortion in different ways as described in the table below.\n   BIAS EFFECT     NEGATIVE BIAS Boosts at the higher frequencies similar to an under-biased tape machine.   POSITIVE BIAS Attenuates some of the higher frequencies and at high values can severely reduce dynamic-range providing more compression similar to an over-biased tape machine.    Extreme Bias for Extreme Effect\nIf you want to add some serious crunch to stems and mixes, move the bias control towards its extremes and conjure the vibe of an old workhorse tape machine.\n Vintage Tape Calculates Your Output Levels\nOn a real tape machine, any adjustments made to bias, speed, or input drive requires recalibration to all the other variables. The Vintage Tape module intelligently calculates these shifts while you make adjustments.\n Harmonics Adjust the slider to add even-harmonic distortion. This saturation can be used to add complexity and richness.\n   HARMONICS EFFECT     0 (DEFAULT) Tape emulation similar to the odd-harmonic saturation of magnetic tape.   ABOVE ZERO Tape emulation similar to even-harmonic saturation introduced by inaccuracies in the AC bias design or distortion from machine electronics.    Low Emphasis Controls the shape of the resonant peak (also known as “Head Bump”) in dB, which adds gain or a gentle peak to bass or kick drum material. Keeping this control at 2.0 will add a very subtle amount of head bump, but pushing the higher limits of this slider can give you low-end power.\n   LOW EMPHASIS VALUE (dB) EFFECT     LOWER VALUE Removes the resonant peak, flattening out the frequency response while maintaining the low-end rolloff. This can help achieve the warmth of analog without adding mud or too much bass.   HIGHER VALUE Boosts the resonant peak up to 10dB, adding low end punch and emphasis.    Tape Speed Affects Resonant Frequency\nSimilar to a traditional tape machine, the resonant frequency is affected by the tape speed you select.\n At 30 IPS, the head bump sits right around 50 Hz. At 15 IPS, the head bump sits an octave below that. \n High Emphasis Adjust to compensate for high-frequency losses to give your audio extra energy without being too harsh or bright. The default setting of 4.0 gives you an authentic, close-to-flat high frequency response.\n   HIGH EMPHASIS VALUE (dB) EFFECT     LOWER VALUE Adds gentle, roll-off at high-frequencies.   HIGHER VALUE Adds a high-end shimmer.    ",

            "text": "ADV Overview When converting to a lossy audio format (such as MP3 or AAC), psychoacoustic algorithms are used to truncate the less audible components of your audio. This means that parts of your audio are actually being removed, which has a subtle (or obvious, at lower bit rates) affect on the sound.\nCodec Preview allows you to hear what your master will sound like after lossy audio compression has taken place, and gives you the opportunity to compensate for this data loss without leaving your DAW. For example, when converting to a low bit rate MP3, you may want to brighten your audio slightly, to counteract the loss of high frequency data.\n Accessing Codec Preview The Codec Preview panel can be accessed by clicking the Codec button in the Auditioning section of the Ozone application and the main Ozone 8 plug-in.\n Codec Preview Availability\nCodec Preview is an Advanced only feature and is not available in the component plug-ins. You can access Codec Preview in the main Ozone plug-in and Ozone application.\n  Signal Flow Codec Preview is at the very end of the signal chain within Ozone. When you are using Ozone as a plug-in, it is important that Ozone is placed after all other inserts if you are using Codec Preview. This will ensure that the signal going into Codec Preview includes all of the processing being applied to the mix.\nCodec Preview is intended to be used for previewing only and will not apply actual MP3 or AAC compression when exporting from the Ozone application or a DAW. You can use the Codec Preview feature to help inform the export settings of your host application, but be sure to disable the feature prior to exporting When you enable Codec Preview, codec preview processing is reflected in the:\n I/O Panel output meters: monitor clipping that might occur as a result of lossy compression. Spectrum meters: useful for monitoring the effect of lossy compression with regard to frequency, specifically, in the high end when auditioning lower bit rates.   Controls The Codec Preview panel includes the following controls:\n Format Bit Rate Solo Artifacts   Format Select the codec format to preview: MP3 or AAC.\nOZONE CODEC FORMAT INFORMATION\n AAC: Ozone uses the Fraunhofer AAC codec. MP3: Ozone uses the LAME codec www.mp3dev.org. \n Sample Rates \u0026amp; Performance\nAAC and MP3 files do NOT support sample rates greater than 48kHz.\n If your session sample rate is set to a value other than 44.1kHz or 48kHz, Ozone will perform high-quality real-time resampling when you enable Codec Preview. Real-time resampling requires high CPU usage. This may incur significant latency especially within high sample rate sessions that utilize small buffer sizes. Most hosts should be able to compensate for this latency, but you may notice a slight delay in playback when Codec Preview is enabled. We recommend adjusting the buffer size to a larger value to avoid any discontinuities or performance issues when using Codec Preview within high sample rate sessions. \n Bit Rate (Constant) Sets the constant bit rate value used by Codec Preview.\n   BIT RATE OPTIONS     96 kbps   112 kbps   128 kbps   160 kbps   192 kbps   224 kbps   256 kbps   320 kbps    MONO TRACKS AND BIT RATES\nOzone 9 offers a range of bit rates. If you are working on a mono track, Codec Preview will only support preview of 96 kbps through 256 kbps.\n Solo Artifacts Enable to hear the audio data being lost (artifacts) in the codec conversion.\nCODEC ARTIFACT SIGNAL DERIVATION\nThe codec artifact signal is the codec preview signal subtracted from the unencoded signal.\n ",

The drawn curve represents the general frequency curve of the specific dither noise profile.\n  Controls Dither includes the following set of controls in the control panel which allow you to talior your audio conversion processing:\n Bit Depth Dither Amount Noise Shaping Bit Meter DC Offset Meter   Bit Depth Select the target bit depth for your audio: 24, 20, 16,12, or 8.\nIdeal CD Bit Options\nWhen mastering for CD, industry standards recommend your Bit Depth be set to 16 bit.\n Note: 8 \u0026amp; 12 Bit Options\nThe 8 \u0026amp; 12 bit options in the Dither panel are preview only WITHIN the Ozone application, you cannot use 8 or 12 bit Dither when exporting from the Ozone application.\n Auto-Blanking Selecting this option will completely mute dither output (i.e. dither noise) when the input signal is completely silent (0 bits of audio) for at least 0.7 seconds.\nDither Amount Select the target number of bits or amount of dither that will be used. Dither Amount options are outlined in the table below\n   DITHER AMOUNT EFFECT     Strong Completely eliminates the non-linear distortion issues that may result from using Off or Low, but this comes at the expense of a slightly increased noise floor.   Medium Recommended choice for the Dither Amount setting.   Low Can leave some non-linear quantization distortion or dither noise modulation.   Off Can leave some non-linear quantization distortion or dither noise modulation.    Harmonic Suppression Enable to slightly alter the truncation rules, moving the harmonic quantization distortion away from overtones of audible frequencies to maintain better tonal quality in the resulting signal.\nHarmonic Suppresion and Artifacts\nThis option doesn’t create any random dithering noise floor. Truncation results in harmonic quantization distortion that adds overtones to the signal and distorts the timbre.\n Limit Peaks When enabled, the Limit Peaks control allows you to effectively suppress the spurious peaks caused by aggressive dither settings.\nDither Noise and Spurious Peaks\nDither noise is random in nature and has a very low amplitude, so dither peaks are not often a problem. However, depending on your dithering settings, especially more aggressive modes, the high frequency dither noise can be amplified significantly after noise shaping. This can result in spurious peaks in the overall dither signal (up to -60 dBFS for 16-bit quantization).\n Noise Shaping Selects the amount of noise shaping that is applied during the dithering process ranging from Off (no shaping) through Max (roughly 14 dB of audible noise suppression).\nNoise Shaping Effects\nNoise shaping pushes the noise necessary for dithering into less audible frequency ranges, allowing for greater dithering with less perceived noise. Different amounts of noise shaping will have subtle effects on the sound quality of the dither process, so experiment with the different settings with your particular program material.\n Bit Meter Monitor the digital activity of your program material and the state of bits to look for problems or discontinuities in the digital signal. This can be an invaluable resource for monitoring the digital activity of your program material, including viewing:\n Range of bits (dynamic range) being used Output word length Faulty A/D converters Sub-par plug-in processing  Bit Meter Columns The columns bit meter provides specific information on the activity of the bits comprising your audio. The columns show which bits are being used. If a bit is used (goes from 1 to 0 or vice versa), the position for that bit is lit.The image and table blow outline the type of activiy being displayed by each column pair.\n    LABEL COLUMN REFERENCE DESCRIPTION      Inner Columns Displays the real-time activity of the bits of audio, for the left and right channels.    Outer Columns Displays the real-time activity in a “peak hold” way, retaining momentary information. If the inner columns toggle or “light up”, the outer columns will show that bit as being used.    Using the Bit Meter Effectively In general, you want to see activity on each of the bits (except the top one, see below for explanation). Meaning that over a period of a few seconds each of the bits in the outside columns should be lit.\nYou should also click on the meter periodically to reset the peak hold of the outside columns. Something like DC offset would toggle a lower bit once (lighting the outside column), but would never toggle it after that since the bit is being held.\nIf you’re dithering down, you only want to see 16, 12, or 8 bits lit (corresponding to the output bit depth of the dither).\n Identifying Signal Problems in Bit Meter Some examples of problems you can identify with a bit meter are:\n HEADROOM: You may have a 24 bit audio file, but aren’t using all of the bits. 16 BITS: In a more extreme case, you are only using 16 bits. If you’re dithering to 16 bits, this is what you want to see. However, if you’re not dithering, this would suggest there is a problem somewhere, either an A/D converter that is only putting out 16 bits, a plug-in that’s truncating the signal down to 16 bits, or others. STUCK BIT: One bit in the middle of the signal isn’t being exercised, possibly due to a faulty A/D converter or bug with a software plug-in. \n Why the Top Bit Will Never Light Up in the Bit Meter\n When samples are stored as a binary number, negative samples are specially encoded. Since the binary representation of negative numbers is not intuitive, Ozone takes the absolute value of each sample before plotting it on the bit meter. Since the most significant bit is only set when a sample is negative, this bit will never light up. We simply included the top bit as placeholder for completeness. \n Reset Enable to reset the bit meter and start its display over with the program material’s current playback point.\nDC Offset Meter Displays the amount of the DC that is being removed when Filter is enabled.\n Filter Enable to activates a high-pass filter with a 1 Hz cutoff frequency that filters DC Offset before limiting.\nDC Offset Requires Maximizer or Vintage Limiter\nYou cannot access the DC offset meter or Filter control unless you have Maximizer or Vintage-Limiter in your signal chain.\n More information about DC Offset\nDC offset is a defect in the recording when the waveform’s average voltage is above or below zero. Audio signals are normally represented by an alternating current (AC) whose average value is zero. Some malfunctions in the recording equipment can result in a direct current leaking into the signal. Thus, the recorded waveform appears to be above or below the zero line.\nIn FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) analyzers, the DC offset is represented with energy at zero frequency (0 Hz). A DC offset can be removed with a high-pass filter. It is important to distinguish DC offset from waveform asymmetry. Asymmetry skews the waveform shape towards positive or negative levels, but the average current stays at zero. Unlike DC offset, asymmetry has no particular energy near 0 Hz and can be reduced using phase rotation filters.\n More information about Dithering\n If you are interested in getting some practical tips for using dithering, as well as some of the theory behind it, please check out the Educational Guides on the iZotope website. Check out the Getting Started chapter for some Dithering tips. \n Dither in Ozone 9 Component Plug-ins\nWhen Using the Plug-In Version of Ozone 9:\n Do NOT perform any processing to your audio AFTER applying Dither. It is OK, however, to perform level adjustment with the Output Gain sliders in Ozone\u0026rsquo;s I/O panel, but do NOT change any levels in the host app or with other plug-ins. Almost all host apps have their master faders after the effects slot, so any level adjustment in the host app will destroy the dither. Do not put any plug-ins after Ozone if you are dithering with Ozone. The dither must be the last thing that touches the audio. Turn off dithering in the host app. \n ",

Dim Controls When Bypassed: Enables an overlay that dims the appearance of controls in the module control panel when Ozone is bypassed.  Authorization \u0026amp; Updates This section of the General options tab allows you to check for updates and manage your authorization.\nCheck for Updates The Check for Updates button has a few different possible states:\n Download Product Portal: To stay up to date with new versions of Relay, download the iZotope Product Portal application. Check for Updates: Manually check for available updates. Clicking this button will open the Product Portal application and check for updates. Download Update: If an update is available, a small blue dot will appear. Clicking the Download Update button in the options window will launch the Product Portal application and display the Updates page.  Authorization This section allows you to manage your Ozone authorization and displays information about your current authorization status.\n Current Authorization Status Text: Displays the current Ozone authorization state. Authorize: Opens the iZotope Authorization wizard. Remove Authorization: Removes the current authorization.  Other The Other section of the General options tab includes settings related to usage analysis and undo history depth.\n Enable Analytics: Enables anonymous usage data to be sent to iZotope to help improve Ozone in the future. History Depth: Determines the number of parameter change events to store in the Undo History list.   Spectrum Tab The Spectrum options tab allows you to manage options related to the Spectrum view in all Ozone modules.\n Spectrum Type Selects the type of spectrum display used by spectrum analyzer views in all Ozone modules. The following options are available:\n Linear: A continuous line connecting the calculated points of the spectrum. 1/3 Octave: Splits the spectrum into bars with a width of 1/3 of an octave. Although the spectrum is split into discrete bands, this option can provide excellent resolution at lower frequencies. Critical: Splits the spectrum into bands that correspond to how we hear, or more specifically how we differentiate between sounds of different frequencies. Each band represents sounds that are considered \u0026ldquo;similar\u0026rdquo; in frequency. Full Octave: Splits the spectrum into bars with a width of one full octave.  Fill Spectrum Allows you to display the real-time spectrum as a solid graph as opposed to a line graph. This option can be used to differentiate the real-time spectrum from the peak hold spectrum.\nPeak Hold Time (ms) Sets the length of time the peak hold display will hold before updating. You can choose between specific hold times (in milliseconds) or Infinite, where the peak display is held indefinitely.\nShow Peak Hold Toggles whether Ozone displays and holds the peaks of the spectrum.\nWindow Type Sets the window type for the spectrum. In most cases the default window type will work well, but you can choose from a variety of window types. Each window type has different amplitude and frequency resolution characteristics.\nWindow Size Set to controls the tradeoff between time and frequency resolution in the spectrum analyzer. Higher values offer greater frequency resolution.\nAverage Time Averages the spectrum according to this setting. Higher average times can be useful for viewing the overall tonal balance of a mix, while shorter average times provide a more real-time display. Options include: Real Time, 1 sec, 3 sec, 5 sec, 10 sec, and Infinite.\nFrequency Scale Modifies the distribution of frequencies along the frequency axis of the spectrum analyzer. The default frequency scale is Extended Log.\n EQ Tab The EQ tab includes EQ Spectrum and Performance options. These options will apply to both Equalizer 1 and Equalizer 2 modules.\n Spectrum The following options will affect the spectrum in the Equalizer 1 and 2 modules.\nAlt-Solo Filter Q Sets the bandwidth (Q) of the Alt-Solo feature in the Equalizer module(s).\nShow Extra Curves Toggles the display of Phase Delay, Phase Response, and Group Delay curves in the EQ spectrum.\nPerformance  Soft Saturation: Select to enable soft saturation to in the EQ module. When enabled, signals that clip as a result of being boosted by the EQ will saturate with an analog character, rather than harsh digital clipping. Buffer Size: Select to adjusts the memory buffer size, measured in samples, when applying equalization to the signal. Frequency Resolution: Select to set the minimum resolution, in Hz, the Equalizer can be adjusted by. You can choose from: 3 Hz, 6 Hz, 12 Hz, 24 Hz, and 48 Hz. Filter Size: Displays the calculated steepness of the filter setting used in the EQ module.   Dynamics Tab  Crossover Type Select from analog, digital or hybrid as the crossover type used for multiband processing in the Dynamics module.\n Analog: Provides a natural analog character. Digital: Provides a more transparent sounding crossover. Hybrid: A perfect reconstruction IIR analog crossover designed to reduce phase distortion and frequency distortion found in other analog crossovers while maintaining precise crossover points and the warm characteristics of analog crossovers.  Crossover Buffer Size Determines how large of a digital audio buffer is used in the Dynamics module crossovers.\nCrossover Q When using the Digital crossover type, you can manually set the bandwidth of the crossover points in the Dynamics module. A higher Q results in tighter crossovers, while a lower Q provides a more gradual transition from one band to the next.\nLook Ahead [ms] Determines how far ahead the dynamics processor looks ahead, within the loaded digital audio file, in order to provide as transparent and effective dynamics controls as possible. The look ahead time ranges from 0 to 10 ms.\n Imager Tab  Prevent Antiphase Select to automatically prevent any settings from being applied that would result in phase cancellation of the stereo signal, when summed to mono.\nVectorscope Detection Method Select to set which type of amplitude detection method is used by the Vectorscope.\n Peak: When this option is enabled, Ozone’s detection circuit looks at peak levels of the incoming signal. In general this is useful when you’re trying to even out sudden peaks in your music. RMS: When this option is enabled, Ozone looks at the average level of the incoming signal. RMS detection is useful when you’re trying to increase the overall volume level without changing the character of the sound. Envelope: Envelope mode behaves much like RMS mode, but with some key advantages. Unlike RMS, True Envelope mode produces even levels across all frequencies.  Crossover Type Select from analog, digital or hybrid as the crossover type used for multiband processing in the Imager module.\n Analog: Provides a natural analog character. Digital: Provides a more transparent sounding crossover. Hybrid: A perfect reconstruction IIR analog crossover designed to reduce phase distortion and frequency distortion found in other analog crossovers while maintaining precise crossover points and the warm characteristics of analog crossovers.  Crossover Buffer Size Determines how large of a digital audio buffer is used in the Imager module crossovers.\nCrossover Q Adjust to manually set the bandwidth of the crossover points in the Imager module, when using the Digital crossover type. A higher Q results in tighter crossovers, while a lower Q provides a more gradual transition from one band to the next.\n Dynamic EQ Tab The Dynamic EQ options tab allows you to manage options related to general display options related to the Dynamic EQ module.\n Show Musical Units Select to display frequency points as musical notes (for example, A4) instead of measured in Hz.\nAlt-Solo Filter Q Adjust to set the bandwidth (Q) of the Alt-Solo feature in the Dynamic EQ module. This setting ranges from .2 to 12.\n Exciter Tab  Crossover Type Select from analog, digital or hybrid as the crossover type used for multiband processing in the Exciter module.\n Analog: Provides a natural analog character. Digital: Provides a more transparent sounding crossover. Hybrid: A perfect reconstruction IIR analog crossover designed to reduce phase distortion and frequency distortion found in other analog crossovers while maintaining precise crossover points and the warm characteristics of analog crossovers.  Crossover Buffer Size Determines how large of a digital audio buffer is used in the Exciter module crossovers.\nCrossover Q Adjust to manually set the bandwidth of the crossover points in the Exciter module, when using the Digital crossover type. A higher Q results in tighter crossovers, while a lower Q provides a more gradual transition from one band to the next.\n I/O Tab  Enable I/O Meters Select to enable/disable the meters in Ozone’s master I/O section.\nDetect True Peaks Select Detect True Peaks to accurately measure the signal that will result from digital to analog conversion. By default the Input/Output meters will only indicate clipping which occurs within the digital domain.\nEnable Legacy Bypass Gain Match Behavior Select to enable legacy bypass processing on the Gain Match feature in the auditioning section.\nBehavior when Legacy Bypass Gain Match is Checked\nWhen Ozone is on there are many modules such as the multiband dynamics and loudness maximizer that can affect the overall or perceived loudness of the mix. This makes it very hard to compare \u0026ldquo;Ozone on\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Ozone bypassed.\u0026rdquo; The \u0026ldquo;Automatically Match Effective Gain When Bypassed\u0026rdquo; feature solves this problem. Ozone determines how much perceived gain is being added by all of the active Ozone modules and then automatically adds this amount of gain when Ozone is put into bypass mode. You can bypass Ozone, and the gain is automatically adjusted so that when you A/B Ozone on and off, the apparent volume is the same. This gain processing is the only processing that is applied when Ozone is bypassed, and it is of course only applied when Ozone is actually bypassed.\n Behavior when Legacy Bypass Gain Match is Unchecked\nEnabling Gain Match in the I/O section when this option is disabled will result in the output gain sliders auto-adjusting apparent output level to match the dry signal level. The output faders will turn blue when they are auto adjusting level. This is useful to A/B the effect of Ozone processing. Unlike the legacy auto gain behavior, we recommend turning Gain Match on and off as needed rather than keeping it enabled all the time. This behavior does affect the output of Ozone.\n Legacy Bypass and Host Application\nIn the plug-in version of Ozone, Legacy Bypass Gain Match Behavior may not work if you use the host application to bypass Ozone. If the host application reports that it is bypassed, it will work and the Bypass button in Ozone will automatically depress accordingly. If the host does not report that it is bypassed, Ozone doesn’t know and therefore cannot apply the \u0026ldquo;gain when bypassed.\u0026rdquo;\n Meter Type Choose from one of the following options to set the meter type displayed in the I/O meters:\n RMS: RMS (Root Mean Square) is a software-based implementation of an analog-style level meter. Using different integration times, you can model popular VU or PPM meters. The RMS meter displays the average level calculated over a short window of time. The RMS meter readout will typically be lower than an equivalent PPM meter (Digital/Analog), since it is averaging peaks into the overall loudness. PEAK: The Peak meter is a fast meter that measures instantaneous maximum sample value or peak analog waveform values, depending on the \u0026ldquo;detect inter-sample peaks\u0026rdquo; checkbox. If you are tracking the peaks for possible clipping, the Peak meter is appropriate. RMS + PEAK: This is a combined RMS and Peak meter. This meter displays a lower bright bar representing the average level (RMS) and a higher dimmer bar representing peak level. There is also a moving line above the bar representing the most recent peak level or peak hold. K-SYSTEM: Ozone 9 supports Bob Katz’s K-System metering with simultaneous peak and RMS displays. MOMENTARY: This measurement is a calculation of loudness over the course of 400ms. SHORT TERM: This measurement is a calculation of loudness over the course of 3 seconds. INTEGRATED: This measurement is a calculation of loudness over the course of an indefinite period of time.  Meter Scale Choose from one of the following options to set the range and scale of the I/O Meters:\n dB (Linear): Decibel scale presented linearly from -60 dB to 0. dB (Non-linear): Full decibel scale (dBfs) presented non-linearly. BS.1771: Loudness scale recommended by the ITU that spans from -45 LUFS to -14.0 LUFS. EBU +9: Loudness scale recommended as a default by the EBU that spans from -41.0 LUFS to -14.0 LUFS. EBU +18: Loudness scale recommended for material with a wide Loudness Range by the EBU that spans from -59.0 LUFS to -5.0 LUFS.  LUFS Representation\nLUFS is Loudness Units Full Scale and 1 LUFS = 1 dB.\n Meter Source The following meter source options are available: Stereo and Mid/Side. The I/O meters display Stereo information by default. When the I/O meters are in Mid/Side mode, the meter in the center represents the Mid channel level information and the meters on the left and right represents Side channel level information.\n Gain sliders control Left/Right gain in Mid/Side mode\nThe input and output gain sliders always control the left and right input/output gain, regardless of the Meter Source selection.\n Peak Hold Time (ms) Choose from the following options to set how many consecutive samples of audio must exceed 0 dBFS (full scale) before registering as a peak: 5 ms, 250 ms, 500 ms, 1,000 ms, 5,000 ms, and Infinite.\nIntegration time (ms) Choose from the following options to specify the integration time for the RMS calculation: 10 ms, 50 ms, 300 ms (VU), 1,475 ms, 2,650 ms, 3,825 ms, and 5,000 ms. In most RMS meters, the integration time is set to around 300 ms.\nReadout Selects whether the peak hold section of the meters displays the current peak status (current) or instead displays the highest peak that has occurred in the audio file (max peak).\nShow Peak Hold Displays peak hold bars in the I/O meters.\nOzone App Specific Options The Ozone application options menu includes tabs that are specific to the application. These tabs allow you to manage plug-in scanning and application specific behaviors.\nPlug-in Tab (App Only)  Enabled Plug-in Formats Allows you to individually select which plug-in formats (VST and AudioUnit) will be automatically loaded into Ozone’s \u0026ldquo;Plug-ins\u0026rdquo; section.\nScan Plug-ins Click this button to re-scan the selected plug-in locations and load in any newly installed plug-ins.\nVST Plug-in Folders Displays the currently monitored folder path of where your VST plug-ins reside that are loaded into the \u0026ldquo;Plug-ins\u0026rdquo; section of Ozone. Use in conjunction with the \u0026ldquo;Add VST Folder\u0026rdquo; to add a new location, or the \u0026ldquo;Delete VST Folder\u0026rdquo; to delete a currently displayed folder path.\nApp Tab (App Only)  Enable Waveform Segments Overlay Click to enable the Waveform Segmentation overlay, which is the multicolored bar located just below the waveform. In Ozone 9, every imported audio file is scanned for matching \u0026ldquo;segments,\u0026rdquo; which are displayed as colored bars. This display acts as a helpful color coding of the sections of a song. A mastering engineer can use this display to quickly check every transition, or alternatively A/B the chorus of one song with the chorus of another. The corresponding audio can be selected by clicking on the colored segment, this allows you to easily select a loop region or quickly jump to different sections of a file.\nPlayhead Follows Playback When this control is checked, the playhead will always stop at the location that the stop button is pressed, as opposed to returning to the start position.\n",
