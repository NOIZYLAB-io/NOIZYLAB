Refactor $ARGUMENTS to improve code quality:

Focus areas:
- **Simplify** - Reduce complexity, remove duplication
- **Clarify** - Better naming, clearer structure
- **Modernize** - Use current language features and patterns
- **Optimize** - Improve performance where it matters

Rules:
- Preserve existing behavior (no feature changes)
- Make incremental changes, not complete rewrites
- Explain significant changes briefly
- Run tests if available to verify nothing broke
