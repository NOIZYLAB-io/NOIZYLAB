Scaffold: $ARGUMENTS

Supported types:
- `api <name>` - REST API endpoint with route, handler, validation
- `component <name>` - React/UI component with types and styles
- `model <name>` - Database model with schema and migrations
- `service <name>` - Service class with interface and implementation
- `cli <name>` - CLI command with argument parsing
- `test <name>` - Test file structure with common patterns

Generate production-ready scaffolding:
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Include TypeScript types where applicable
- Add basic error handling
- Include TODO comments for customization points

Create the files directly - don't just show code.
