Explain $ARGUMENTS in a clear, educational way:

1. **Purpose** - What does this code do? What problem does it solve?
2. **How It Works** - Step-by-step walkthrough of the logic
3. **Key Concepts** - Important patterns, algorithms, or techniques used
4. **Dependencies** - What does it rely on? What relies on it?

Use simple language. Assume I understand programming but may not know this specific codebase.
