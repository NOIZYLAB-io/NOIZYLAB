Analyze and fix the issue: $ARGUMENTS

Process:
1. **Understand** - What is the actual error? What's the expected behavior?
2. **Diagnose** - Find the root cause (not just symptoms)
3. **Fix** - Implement the solution
4. **Verify** - Explain how to confirm the fix works

If this is an error message, search the codebase to find where it originates.
If this is a file, look for bugs, type errors, or logic issues.

Apply the fix directly. Don't just explain what to do.
