Create a detailed implementation plan for: $ARGUMENTS

Structure:
1. **Goal** - One sentence describing the outcome
2. **Approach** - High-level strategy (1-3 sentences)
3. **Steps** - Numbered, actionable steps
4. **Files** - List files that will be created/modified
5. **Risks** - What could go wrong, how to mitigate
6. **Verification** - How to confirm it works

Keep it concise. This is a plan, not documentation.

After presenting the plan, ask: "Ready to execute?"
