## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Would a new team member understand this?
- [ ] Are examples included?
- [ ] Is it up to date with the code?
- [ ] Are edge cases documented?
- [ ] Is the format consistent?

## Style Guidelines

- Use present tense ("Returns" not "Will return")
- Be concise but complete
- Include code examples
- Document the "why" not just the "what"
- Use consistent formatting
